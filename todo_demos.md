# todo list for test_three.js demos

This is a todo list where I am drafting out ideas for demos that I will include in blog posts on three.js on my website here at github pages.

## threejs-examples-guy2
    * start a new guy2 model that will have a few more mesh objects compared to guy1
    * guy2 will have 3 mesh objects for each arm rather than just one
    * guy2 will have 3 mesh objects for each leg rather than just one
    * have a Guy2Mod.setWalk method but have it so that it will just move the legs, or that the movement of arms is an option
    * have a method that can be used to move a single arm in many differt ways within set range limits
    * do some reading an animation clips and see if they can be used to help with tweening from one state to another

## threejs-object3d-parent
    * start a basic parent example of a mesh
    * start an example that involves raycaster and getting the group of a mesh

## threejs-extrude-geometry
    * start a basic example of THREE.ExtrudeGeometry

## threejs-shape
    * start a basic example of THREE.Shape
    * have an example that makes use of ExtrudeGeometry

## threejs-edges-geometry
    * start a basic demo on the EdgesGeometry constructor

## (started 5/28/2021 ) threejs-clock
    * (done) start a basic demo of THREE.Clock
    * (done) start an example for elapsed time

## (started 5/27/2021 ) TorusGeometry
    * (done) start a basic TorusGeometry demo
    * (done) start a group example where I increase segment counts as child index goes up
    * (done) make an example that is a bunch of TorusGeometry mesh objects in a ring like position, and have a camera move threw the holes

## (started 5/26/2021 ) threejs-sphere
    * (done) start a basic example on the sphere geometry
    * (done) start and example on width and height segments
    * (done) start an example of a dome
    * (done) start and example that makes use of the circle geometry to cap a dome created with the sphere geometry
    * (done) start and example that has to do with using more than one material with the sphere geometry
    * start a demo that makes use of bounding sphere

## (started 5/25/2021 ) threejs-object3d-get-world-position
    * (done) basic world position example that gets the world position of a mesh in a group

## ( started 5/24/2021 ) threejs-object3d-visible
    * (done) start a basic r127 example of object3d-visible
    * start an example that makes use of object3d visible and transparency
    * start an example that makes use of distance from a point for a mesh that moves
