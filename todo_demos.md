# todo list for test_three.js demos

This is a todo list where I am drafting out ideas for demos that I will include in blog posts on three.js on my website here at github pages.

## DEMOS: TorusGeometry
    * start a basic TorusGeometry demo
    * make an example that is a bunch of TorusGeometry mesh objects in a ring like position, and have a camera move threw the holes

## DEMOS: threejs-object3d-parent
    * start a basic parent example of a mesh
    * start an example that involves raycaster and getting the group of a mesh

## (started 5/26/2021 ) DEMOS: threejs-sphere
    * (done) start a basic example on the sphere geometry
    * (done) start and example on width and height segments
    * (done) start an example of a dome
    * (done) start and example that makes use of the circle geometry to cap a dome created with the sphere geometry
    * (done) start and example that has to do with using more than one material with the sphere geometry
    * start a demo that makes use of bounding sphere

## (started 5/25/2021 ) DEMOS: threejs-object3d-get-world-position
    * basic world position example that gets the world position of a mesh in a group

## ( started 5/24/2021 ) DEMOS: threejs-object3d-visible
    * (done) start a basic r127 example of object3d-visible
    * start an example that makes use of object3d visible and transparency
    * start an example that makes use of distance from a point for a mesh that moves
