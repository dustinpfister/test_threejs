## x - what to finish that is in Process, random notes

* When it comes to other ways to position something on a sphere, another solution might involve ray casting
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54491088/wrap-threejs-mesh-on-another-mesh

* see about finishing /r127/sphere-move-point demo
* update post on Vector3 class to include what was worked out in the post on arrow helpers when moving a mesh




## x - More on shapes, extrude Gemoerty

There is maybe a git more to cover when it comes to using the extrude geometry constructor. This can also involve example type posts.

## x.1 - threejs-extrude-geometry
    * start a basic example of THREE.ExtrudeGeometry




## x - Bones, Animation, and External Files

In order to create a collection of posts on animation it might have to involve creating external files in blender.

### x.1 - threejs-animation-mixer
    * basic animation mixer example

### x.2 - threejs-animation-clip
    * basic animation clip example

### x.3 - threejs-skinned-mesh
    * see about making a basic example of a skinned mesh

### x.4 - threejs-skeleton
    * basic skeleton example

### x.5 - threejs-bones
    * (done) see about starting a basic example of a bones created from the examples on the threejs website
    * (done) rename bones demo folder to bones-threejs-site-example.
    * make an actually working basic example of THREE.Bone




## x - New example posts

I can always just make more example posts using my current understating of threejs, and JavaScript alone, as well as expand into other libraries and new concepts when it comes to making modules, videos, and applications with threejs as part of the stack. I am thinking that I should mainly stick to just using threejs and vanilla javaScript, however I might want to make use or other libraries on the open web too now and then when doing so is called for.

### x.1 - threejs-examples-guy-two
    * start a new guy2 model that will have a few more mesh objects compared to guy1
    * guy2 will have 3 mesh objects for each arm rather than just one
    * guy2 will have 3 mesh objects for each leg rather than just one
    * have a Guy2Mod.setWalk method but have it so that it will just move the legs, or that the movement of arms is an option
    * have a method that can be used to move a single arm in many different ways within set range limits
    * do some reading an animation clips and see if they can be used to help with tweening from one state to another

### x.2 - threejs-examples-unit-vector-system
    * start an example that is based off of the concept of a unit vector 
    * ( see moving a mesh example in post on arrow helpers )
