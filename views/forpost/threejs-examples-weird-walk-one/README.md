# threejs-examples-weird-walk-one

I wanted to make another one of my threejs projects that creates a model by just making a group of mesh objects. One of the oldest examples of this kind of project would be my guy one model that I made a few years ago now. Although I now know how to make models that are a little more professional that this kind of approach I have come to enjoy making these kinds of projects. So then I came up with this [weird walk one model](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/04/18/threejs-examples-weird-walk-one/) that is just yet another exmaple of this kind of project.
