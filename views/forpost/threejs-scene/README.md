# threejs-scene

This is my collection of source code examples for my [post on the scene object in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/05/03/threejs-scene/). The Scene object is the main root object that will contain all additional child objects that will be in the over all scene of a project. The scene object is then passed to the render function of a rendering along with a camera as a way to visualize the over all collection of objects that compose a typical threejs project.
