# threejs-examples-wrap-module

After working on a set of examples for the subject of wrapping rather than clamping Vector3 class instances in threejs I thought that I should make a module centered around the subject or wrapping values threejs style. This module will then contain a basic wrap value method that can be used to wrap any primitive number value to a range of values. However it will also contain a number of other methods geared for wrapping Vector3 class instances as well as other types of values that might come up as I work out a demo or two for the module.
