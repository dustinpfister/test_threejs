# threejs-points

Source code examples for my blog post on the THREE.Points class in general. Way back when I was first getting started with writing blog posts on threejs back in 2018 I [wrote a post on the points material](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/05/12/threejs-points-material/) in threejs. I have edited that post a number of times sense then, but have found that I should have another main blog post on the subject of using THREE.Points.
