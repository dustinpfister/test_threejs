# threejs-vector3-wrap

There is clamping a Vector3 object to a cubic area, and the  there is also doing the same but with the Vector unit length. When it comes to this there are methods in the vector3 class that make quick work of that sort of thing. However there is also not clapping but wrapping values to a given range. That is so that when they go out of bounds they wrap background to the beginning. This is then what I have togetaher thus far when it comes to the subject of wrapping vector3 objects rather than clamping them.
