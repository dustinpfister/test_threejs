# threejs-sphere

These are the source code examples that I have together thus far for [my post on spheres in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/26/threejs-sphere/). When I first started writing this post the focus was mainly with just the built in geometry constructor alone. However when it comes to additional edits of this post I will have to start looking into additional examples that have more to do with spheres in general in the threejs library. For example there are other ways of making a sphere geometry, and sphere like geometries such as using 2d curves and the lathe geometry class. There is also not creating a geometry of a sphere, but rather positioning objects in a sphere like way.
