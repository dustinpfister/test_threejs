# threejs-sphere

These are the source code examples that I have together thus far for [my post on spheres in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/26/threejs-sphere/). When I first started writing this post the focus was mainly with just the built in geometry constructor alone, however when it comes to additional edits of this post I will have to start looking into additional examples that have more to do with other things that come up when working with threejs in a project.
