# threejs-examples-sequence-hooks

While working on my electronjs applaction that I use to make videos called videoground I wanted to make a javaScript module that helps with the process of breaking things down into sequences. That is that I would like to have some kind of system where I create a collection of sequence objects, and in each object I have a way to define how many frames or seconds long the sequence is. There is then also a for frame method for each sequence object in which I can define logic that I want to run for each frame for each sequence. Thus I started such a javaScript module that does just that.

I then wanted to add at least a few more features in terms of addtional hooks that fire before, and after the current for frame method is fired. This example is then just that project that is simply just a slightly more improved project from the bore basic sequences project. As with all folders in this post I have [wrote a blog post on this sequence hooks module](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/05/12/threejs-examples-sequence-hooks/) and a few demos of its use.
