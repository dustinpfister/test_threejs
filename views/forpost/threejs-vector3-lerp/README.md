# threejs-vector3-lerp

The [lerp method of the Vector3 class](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/05/17/threejs-vector3-lerp/) can be used to move a current vector to another vector by a given alpha value. There is just working out a simple hello world style demo of this, but then there is a lot more to write about when it comes to alpha values, and other vector3 class methods.
