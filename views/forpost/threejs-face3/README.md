# threejs-face3

These are the source code examples for my post on the old Face3 constructor in threejs. The last version of threejs in which I tested out my source code examples on Face3 was r111, with new versions of threejs the groups array of a geometry is what to use not to set up or chnage material index values for a geomerty.

## Needed Files
