# threejs-object-grid-wrap-land

When I first made my object grid wrap module the idea came to me to use this module as a way to create a grid that looks like land in terms of some mountainous terrain. The project would then build on top of the source code that I all ready worked out with my older object grid wrap module. So with just be a little additional javaScript code I will be setting up one of these grid wrap objects that I create with the object grid wrap mdoule.

## The land-set-one DAE file

As of late revisions of the module I am now making use of a DAE file as a way to create the land sections that I like better then the code solutions that I made when first starting the module. The [Dae file is caled land-set-one](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/dae/land-set-one), and on top of the land section tiles it also contains a lot of other objects that I might want to have as children as well.
