# threejs-buffer-geometry-utils

There is the buffer geometry utils module that can be pulled from the examples folder of the threejs github repository. This module contains a few tools to use with buffer geometry that can prove to be useful in select situations, but are not baked into the Buffer Geometry class itself.

## Other Posts on Buffer Geometry utils

I have been looking around a bit to see if I can fine a decent post on this subject. Thus far I can not say that I have found anything in that regard. All the more reason to write one then I guess, but it is still nice to fine other posts on a topic. I am sure there is something at least if I get around to doing some more digging.
