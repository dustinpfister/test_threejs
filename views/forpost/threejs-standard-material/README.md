# threejs-standard-material

I have found that I generally like to go with the standard materials when creating a mesh object for a threejs project. It works okay with most lighting situations, as well as many other general use case situations. I have wrote a [blog post on the topic of the standard material](/https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/27/threejs-standard-material/) and as such this is what I have together in terms of source code examples for that specific post.
