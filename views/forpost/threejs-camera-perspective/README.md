# threejs-camera-perspective

These are the source code examples that I am using for [my post on the perspective camera](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/07/threejs-camera-perspective/) in threejs. This Perspective Camera object is one of many options when it comes to cameras, but it is the one that typically will be used in many projects as it is the kind of camera that mimics the way that the human eye sees, rather than some other kind of camera that is more in tune with how objects actually exist is space.
