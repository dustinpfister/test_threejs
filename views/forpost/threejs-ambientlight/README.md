# threejs-ambientlight

This is what I have for source code examples for my [post an Ambient Light in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/11/02/threejs-ambientlight/). This light option will apply a base amount of light for all surfaces of all mesh materials that work with light sources. It is often not used by itself, but used in conjunction with other options for light sources such as directional light.
