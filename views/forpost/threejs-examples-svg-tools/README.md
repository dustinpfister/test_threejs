# examples-svg-tools 

I would like to start working on some projects that will make use of svg files as a way to create a logo. There is just simply loading the svg file and creating an extrude geometry with it. However there will be a lot more that will come up as I work on this sort of thing of course and this is the current state of a project that i started to help with this sort of thing.
