# threejs-depth-material

The depth material is one of many options for a material in threejs, this one can be used to render textures for a mesh that is based on the location of the mesh relative to the camera. Here I have the source code examples for [my blog post on this depth material option](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/04/threejs-depth-material/) that I write about in detail there.
