## Mouse Control Problem

The mouse controls only seem to work well when the full width and height of the window is used. It would seem that there is no option for setting the controls to adjust based on the position of the parent element. So to get mouse controls working one will need to use the full width and height of the page, or maybe look into a solution that involves and iframe.

## Keyboad controls

I found [This post](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-control-three-js-camera-like-a-pro-a8575a717a2) On fly controls that displays what the keybaod controls are.


* WASD (W: forward, S: backward, A: left, D: right)
* RF (R: elevate, F: descend)
* QE (roll)
* ↑ ↓ (pitch)
* ← →(yaw)
