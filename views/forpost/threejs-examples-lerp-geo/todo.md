## () r2 - 
* () see about fixing the problem when comparing lerpGeo methiod to the use of the new create and update methods
* () if I can fix what is wrong remove or update the mian lerp geo method

## ( done 02/06/2023 ) r1-1-basic - test old old and new methods
* (done) make sure old r0 lerp geo funciton still works
* (done) test out new create method

## ( done 02/06/2023 ) r1 - using morph attributes now
* (done) have it so that R1 can still be used as a drop in replacement for R0
* (done) have a new create function that can be called off from the main lerpGeo global funciton
* (done) the create function takes an array of geometry objects
* (done) have a helper funciton that will get the position attribute with the highest count
* (done) the geometry with the highest posiiton count will be used to create the main geometry that is returned
* (done) Have a createGeo public method that will just create and return a geometry
* (done) Have the main create method return a mesh object
* (done) have an update method that will take a mesh object, and an array of alpha values

## ( done 12/19/2022 ) r0-2-four
* (done) example that involves four geos

## ( done 12/19/2022 ) r0 - module form of lerp geo
* (done) create a module form of the lerp geo module
* (done) r0-1-cone-sphere demo

## ( done 2022/07/01 ) - for post folder started
