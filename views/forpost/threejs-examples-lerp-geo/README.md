# threejs examples lerp geo

This is a threejs example in which I am using a helper function that will [lerp the points of geometry](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/07/01/threejs-examples-lerp-geo/) from one state to another state. This was a project that I started before I got around to making some demos on the morph attributes property of buffer geometry objects which would be a better starting point for getting into this sort of thing. In any case as if I do make an r1 forward with this example I will of course be making use of the morph attributes property from here forward.
