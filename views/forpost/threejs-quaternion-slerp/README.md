# threejs-quaternion-slerp

The slerp method of the quaternion class is simular to other methods like the lerp method of the Vector3 class in that it can be used to transiation one kind of object to another by way of a given alpha value, that is a value between 0 and 1. This is a collection of source code examples that I have togetaher for my blog post on the slerp method of the quaternion class.
