I would like to make at least one if not a few threejs examples that involve creating one or more dae files that are also used in conjunction with additional javaScript files to create a kind of 3d model to play with in video projects. This threejs project examples is then the first such model in which I am working out this new kind of transitional model between the kind of models that I have made up until this point and the kind of models I might make one day if I do stay in my lane with threejs rather than the massive volume of other things within front end javaScript that I could look into more.
