# quadratic-bezier-curve demo for r152

I have wrote a blog post on the 3D form of this kind of method, so now I would like to have at least one if not more of these on the 2d version of the method. For this first demo I would like to keep it very basic as ushual, so there is maybe seeing about a simple example just using points.
