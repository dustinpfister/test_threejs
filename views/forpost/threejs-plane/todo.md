# threejs-plane todo list

<!-- BASIC SECTION -->

<!-- Raycaster -->

## Maybe add a raycaster section and be sure to like to this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbfy8QP8Lc

<!-- GROUPS SECTION -->

## () s2-3-groups-map
* () example where I can give an array of material index values



<!-- TEXTURES -->

## () - s3-3-texture-wrapst
* () example using the wrapS and wrapT properties

## () - s3-4-texture-uv
* () example in which I am mutating the uv attribute and using a static texture

<!-- TILEMOD -->

## () - expand r0 section
* () have more than one r0 demo of the module

<!-- LOOP -->

## () sx-7-loop-tweenmany
* () loop example making use of my tween many module

## () sx-6-loop-text-plane
* () loop example in which I am using my text plane module

## () sx-5-loop-material-map
* () loop example in which I am using phong material for 'metal' areas, and Lambert for 'wood' areas
* () Try a single texture for both materials, and use uv mapping rather than two textures

## () sx-4-loop-uv
* () loop example in which I ma using uv mapping in place of having more than one material

## () sx-3-loop-position
* () mutate position over time example, maybe a wire frame look with waves
