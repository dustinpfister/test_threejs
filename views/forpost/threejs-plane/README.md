# threejs-plane

This is the collection of source code examples that I have made for my [blog post on plane geometry in the javaScript library known as threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/06/05/threejs-plane/). There is a great deal to write about when it comes to the plane geometry, although much of what comes to mind has to do with buffer geometry in general actually. However plane geometry strikes me a s a good choice for learning about all the core features of buffer geometry when it comes to thinks like adding a groups property and working with an array of materials, or just using a custom texture but mutating the UV attribute over time.
