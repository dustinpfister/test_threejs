# threejs-object-loader todo list

<!-- S3 - TRI12 -->

I would like to have a section on my tri12 butterfly. I can write about the state of the 0.json file of set1-object, as well as additional code that makes use of it. This allows for branching off into a whole lot of other topics that have to do with animation and so forth which would prove to be a great advanced subject for this post.

<!-- S2 - MANAGER -->

I should have a section in which I am using the loading manager to load many files

## () s1-2-manager-many
* () basic many files example using the loading manager

<!-- S1 - BASIC SECTION -->


## () - s1-3-basic-load file
* () demo in which I load one external json file of an object

<!-- DONE -->
