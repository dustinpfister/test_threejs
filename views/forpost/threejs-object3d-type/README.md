# threejs-object3d-type

There is a [type property of various objects in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/04/01/threejs-object3d-type/) that is a string value that seems to correspond with the Constructor name of the function that was used to create the object. So then this type property might prove to be an okay way to find out, well as the name implies, the type of object that i am dealing with when looping over the children of a parent object of one kind or another.
