# threejs-buffer-geometry todo list

## () update examples to use textures
* () update s4 group with texture
* () update s5-light with texture
* () update s6-rotation with texture

## () - new updating loop example
* () have a new simple updating example, maybe using a plain geometry

## () - new copy example
* () - have a new basic copy method example

## () - built in constructor example
* have one or more basic examples that involve the use of the built in geometry constructors
* () combine all the examples that have to do with creating a custom geometry from the ground up into one section with sub sections.

## () s8-2-loader-promise
* () demo using the promise helper function I worked out in in threejs-buffer-geometry-loader
