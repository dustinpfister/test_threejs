# threejs-buffer-geometry

These are the source code examples that I am writing about in my [blog post on buffer geometry](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/22/threejs-buffer-geometry/) in general. The goal here is to have a post that is a nice general overview of making custom geometry with the buffer geometry constructor, as well as features of the Class that apply to buffer geometry in general when it comes to the built in geometry constructors and loading geometry in from external files. 

There is a lot to cover when it comes to buffer geometry, there are the various attributes of a geometry and now to create them with a little javaScript code, prototype methods, and other topics that are related to geometry when it comes to Mesh objects and materials. Attempting to cover everything that needs to be known in a single blog post would have to be done by writing a post that would end up being pretty lengthy. So the general reasoning here is to just briefly cover various things, and then link to additional posts that will get into greater detail.
