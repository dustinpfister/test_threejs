# threejs-buffer-geometry

These are the source code examples that I am writing about in my [blog post on buffer geometry](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/22/threejs-buffer-geometry/) in general. The goal here is to have a post that is a nice general overview of making custom geometry with the buffer geometry constructor, as well as features of the Class that apply to buffer geometry in general when it comes to the built in geometry constructors and loading geometry in from extreal files. 

## Needed Files

* threejs r127
* VertexNormalsHelper.js ( for demos that have to do with the normal attribute )

## Videos for this post

none
