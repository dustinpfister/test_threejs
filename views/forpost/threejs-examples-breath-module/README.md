# threejs-examples-breath-module 

This is what I have together for my [threejs javaScript module project that I am using for making controlled breathing videos](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2023/03/03/threejs-examples-breath-module/).I started this out with my r146 prototype for a 'breath module' which in turn is also based off of some source code that I all ready have done for some video template files in my beta world video content collection. A main goal here then is to just start out with an IIFE format of the module which is still in line with my r146 style rules, and also what I need to do to use it with my video ground application where for now I am still sticking with r146 of threejs. I addition to this I would like to just figure refine what should be part of the module rather than various video projects, abstracting away everything and anything that I find myself repeating from one video project to the next.
