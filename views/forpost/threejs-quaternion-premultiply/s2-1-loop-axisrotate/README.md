# loop-axisrotate

The goal with this loop example is to actual make a stochastic loop, as such I might want to have this as a part in that kind of section if I make enough examples. However if it is just a few demos maybe I should make them all part of a single section. Anyway the deal here is to just have a nice little animation that has to do with rotation of a sphere on an axis.
