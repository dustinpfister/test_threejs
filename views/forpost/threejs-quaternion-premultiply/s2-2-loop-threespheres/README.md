# loop-premultiply 

This demo is based off of what I started for my main post on quaternion

Thus far I have found that the premultiply method of the quaternion class is part of a core set of methods that I am going to want to use.

After doing some quick research this is a method that I will want to use to preform not one but two rotations.
