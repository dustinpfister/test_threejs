# threejs-quaternion todo list

## () s2-2-stochastic-many
* () make a stochastic demo based on the s1-3-basic-many demo

## () break animation loop section into stochastic and deterministic sections
* () rename s2-1-loop-axisrotate to s3-1-stochastic-axisrotate
* () rename s2-2-loop-threespheres to s2-1-deterministic-threespheres

## ( done 04/01/2023 ) expand basic section
* (done) s1-2-basic-order demo that shows that the order does matter verry much
* (done) s1-3-basic-many demo that involves three or more rotations

## ( done 03/31/2023 ) - new s2-1-loop-axisrotate
* (done) rename s2-1-loop-threespheres to s2-2-loop-threespheres
* (done) start new s2-1-loop-axisrotate
* (done) have one sphere where I rotate on up axis first
* (done) have another one where it is the other way around
