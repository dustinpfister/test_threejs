# threejs-quaternion-premultiply

Demos for my post on the premultiply method of the quaternion class.

## Future Edits.

When it comes to getting into more complex topics like quaternion objects I am starting to think that I might want to break down my ushual animation loop sections into deterministic and stochastic sections. This is somthing that I might need to refine on more before going ahead with it though. Aside from this there is just improving the quality of the exmaples that are all ready in place, these days I am thinking less is more with these demos.
