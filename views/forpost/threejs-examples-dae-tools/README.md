# threejs-examples-dae-tools

These are source code examples that have to do with a dae tools module that I write about in detail in [my blog post on this](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/25/threejs-examples-dae-tools/). The dae tools file was at first just an abstraction of the dae loader, and the loader manager that is built into threejs itself. The aim is to have something that is a bit more than just an abstraction though by adding some additional features that have to do with processing the results, providing a progress bar, and any other additional features that I would want to have on top of just loading the files. However I think this module will remain fairly minimal for the most part as just yet another one of my threejs simple project examples.

## Files needed

* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r127/build/three.min.js)  ( r127 )
* [ColladaLoader.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/r127/examples/js/loaders/ColladaLoader.js) ( r127 )
* [dae_tools.js](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/js/utils/dae_tools) ( v0.1.0+ )


## Videos for this post

For this post I would like to create a demo video, however as of this writing it is very much a work in progress.
