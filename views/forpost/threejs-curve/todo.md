# threejs-curve

## () - finish sx-data-curve section
* finish the data curve section

## () - s7-2-rotateobjects-moveandlook
* () set up a curve path
* () have a cone mesh move along the curve path
* () have another mesh that will be th current lookat point along the curve path

## () - s7-1-rotateobjects-basic
* () - start a new section where the focus is using curves to set the rotation of an object
* () - have a mesh that uses the cone geoetry
* () - use another mesh to mark the current point to look at in a curve

## () - s6-1-moveobjects-basic
* () - start a collection of demos that have to do with using curves to move objects
* () - this first basic example can just be a single curve

## () - s5-1-alphas-line
* (done) start the first of a collection of examples where I am using 2d curves to create alpha values
* (done) I am going to want to start this demo with the canvas loop demo from threejs-getting-started

* () I would like to have a simple 2d graph overlay for the 2d canvas layer
* () this first curve alpha demo can be a single cubic bezier curve

## ( done 05/31/2023 ) - s4-2-2dcurves-lathe
* (done) use the lathe geoetry and a 2dShape created with one or more curves

## ( done 05/31/2023 ) - s4-1-2dcurves-shape
* (done) have a simple 2d demo of a shape using the extrude geometry

## ( done 05/31/2023 ) - s3-1-curvepaths
* (done) start the first demo for a section on curve paths
* (done) this demo can just use THREE.Points

## ( done 05/31/2023 ) - combine s3, and s4 demos in new s3-x-customsincurve section
* (done) rename s3-spiral1 to s3-1-customsincurve-spiral
* (done) rename s4-copy to s4-2-customsincurve-buffer-geometry-copy

## ( done 05/24/2023 ) - s2-3-points-update-alpha
* (done) continue with the get point method by starting a demo where the alpha will be updated over time
* (done) this will then need to be an update loop example
* (done) use the lerp method of the math utils object to lerp an alpha value from one state to another

## ( done 05/24/2023 ) s2-2-points-getpoint
* (done) have a simple demo that is about getting a single point along a curve
* (done) use the get point method
* (done) use a method like smootherstep of the math utils object to get a differing spacing

## ( done 05/24/2023 ) s2-1-points-getpoints
* (done) have a simple demo that is about getting a count of points
* (done) use the get points curve class method

## ( done 05/24/2023 ) move files, r146 style
* (done) move files to root of demo folders
* (done) r146 style update

## ( done 10/20/2022 ) s1-1-basic-line

## ( done 10/20/2022 ) s1-2-basic-bezier

## ( done 10/20/2022 ) rename s1-basic to s1-3-basic-tube

## ( done 06/29/2022 ) - new s3-copy
* (done) new example that involves updaing the geometry by making use of the copy method.

## ( done 06/27/2022 ) - rename s1-basic to s2-spiral1 and start new s1-basic
* (done) rename s1-basic to s2-spiral1
* (done) start new s1-basic that is just a simple Math.pow curve

## ( done 06/27/2022 ) - make data curve section folder draft
* (done) I am thinking that I should make the data curve section a draft folder for now

## ( done 06/27/2022 ) - start for post folder and first set of demos
* (done) current set of examples in post
* (done) basic demo
* (done) data curve example
