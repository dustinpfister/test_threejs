# threejs-curve

This is what I have in terms of source code examples for [my post on the base threejs curve class](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/06/17/threejs-curve/). When I first started this post my aim was to write a few demos that have to do with making a custom curve class from the ground up. Over time with various edits the post is turning into a main blog post on curves in general in threejs.
