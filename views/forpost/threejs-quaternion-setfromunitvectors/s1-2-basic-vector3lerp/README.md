# basic-vector3lerp

Basic example in which I am using the lerp method of the Vector3 class to create a new vector3 object that will be used as a to vector3 object when calling the set from unit vectors method. At this time I think I should also make use of addtional Vector3 class methods that are called for at this point such as the normalize, and clone methods.
