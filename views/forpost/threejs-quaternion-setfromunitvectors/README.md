# threejs-quaternion-setfromunitvectors

I would like to get a better sense of what the set from unit vectors method is of the quaternion class, and write one blog post on the single method alone. In the process of doing so I can expand, and improve my main blog post on this subject as well when it comes to the methods section of that post.
