# threejs-quaternion-setfromunitvectors todo list

## ( done 04/02/2023 ) s2-2-loop-applyeuler
* (done) start an animated demo of the s1-3-basic-applyeuler demo

## ( done 04/02/2023 ) s1-3-basic-applyeuler
* (done) basic demo that makes use of applyEuler and euler objects to set the state of the to vector3 object
* (done) have a mesh2 object that can be somehting other that the sphere
* (done) use the apply euler method, and multiply scalar method to set the direction and vector unit length of mesh2
* (done) I can also use this as an example to write about the normalize method with this mesh2 object
* (done) use the normalized vector3 object as the to vector3 object

## ( done 04/02/2023 ) s1-2-basic-vector3lerp and new s1-1-basic
* (done) rename s1-1-basic to s1-2-basic-vector3lerp
* (done) new a1-1-basic that is just vector3 objects alone

## ( done 04/02/2023 ) s2-1-loop-vectorarray
* (done) start the first loop demo that is about an array of vector3 objects

## ( done 04/02/2023 ) start forpost folder, s1-1-basic demo
* (done) start the folder post folder with this todo list, and readme file
* (done) start a very simple s1-1-basic demo
