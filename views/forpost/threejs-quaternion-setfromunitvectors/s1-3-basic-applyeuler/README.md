# basic-applyeuler

Demo in which I use a euler object, along with the apply euler, and multiply scalar methods of the vector3 class methods to set the direction and vector unit length of the position of a mesh2 object. I can then just use the normalize method of the vector3 class to get a unit length of 1 vector from the position of the mesh2 object that will then in turn be used as the to vector3 object when calling the set from unit vectors method.
