# basic-applyeuler

Demo in which I use a euler object, along with the apply euler, and multiply scalar vector3 class methods to set the direction and vector unit length of the position of a mesh2 object. I can then just use the normalize method of the vector3 class to get a to vector3 object to use with the set from unit vectors method of mesh1.
