## Other Blog Posts On Textures

This is still a new post as of the time I have wrote this, so for now I am not seeing it show up in Serach that much. I am seeing my post on data textures though when I search for "threejs textures". In any case I should scope out other content on this topic just like all the others

### DEV Community post on data textures

https://dev.to/nicolasrannou/create-textures-from-data-in-threejs-5bap

This is a post that I found when scoping things out for my post on data texture rather than the base texture class. The author is writing mainly about a feature in the base texture class rater than data textures alone. The feature has to do with the type and format properties of textures that I think I should expand on in detail in this main blog post on textures.
