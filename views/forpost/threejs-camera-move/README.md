# threejs-camera-move

I have a number of examples worked out here that just have to do with the subject of moving a camera around in three.js, to which I am writing about in greater detail in my [blog post on this subject of camera movement in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/12/17/threejs-camera-move/).

The camera object is one of many objects based off of the object3d class, so by learning to move a camera, one also learns how to move objects in general.
