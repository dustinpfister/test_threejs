# threejs-examples-scene-shake

Now and then I might want to have some kind of [scene shake effect](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/06/threejs-examples-scene-shake/) that is triggered by some kind of event. or happens for a number of frames for some video project. This threejs example is then a project in which I am making a kind of scene shake module that will just shake around the main scene object of a threejs project.
