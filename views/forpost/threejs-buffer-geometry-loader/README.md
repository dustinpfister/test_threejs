# threejs-buffer-geometry

In threejs one of the built in options when it comes to external resource loaders is the [buffer geometry loader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/loaders/BufferGeometryLoader). Here I have a collection of [resources that has to do with my blog post on this specific topic on loading buffer geometry from a json file](/https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/12/threejs-buffer-geometry-loader/).
