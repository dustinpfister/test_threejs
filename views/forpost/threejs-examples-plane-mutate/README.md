# threejs-examples-plane-mutate

I started this example as an exercise for playing around with the state of a geometry instance created with one of the built in geometry constructors. As with every other set of examples in this for post folder I have wrote a [blog post on what it is that I have worked out here](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/11/threejs-examples-plane-mutate/) on the topic of mutating a point in space in a plane geometry.
