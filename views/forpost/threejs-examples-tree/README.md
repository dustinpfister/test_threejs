# threejs-examples-tree

This is the source code for the threejs example of a crude evergreen type [tree model in threejs that I wrote a post on](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/07/30/threejs-examples-tree/) for my website here at github pages. In this folder I just have the main javascript file that makes use of the tree model, the source code for the tree model is in the /views/js/modules_group/tree folder of this test\_threejs repo. The idea is that assets such as this tree module will be used in additional projects so I would like to keep it located outside of here.

## Videos for this post

This is the first post that I made a video for using my videoui framework of this test\_threejs repo. When it comes to this forpost folder I will want to make node of any video projects that might end up being updated to a site like youtube and embeded in the blog post. Here I will just like to any and all corespondsing folders in the /views/videos folder.
