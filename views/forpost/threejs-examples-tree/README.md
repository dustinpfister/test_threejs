# threejs-examples-tree

This is the source code for the threejs example of a crude evergreen type tree model in threejs that I wrote a post on for my website here at github pages. In this folder I just have the main javascript file that makes use of the tree model, the source code for the tree model is in the /views/js/modules_group/tree folder of this test\_threejs repo. The idea is that assets such as this tree module will be used in additional projects so I would like to keep it located outside of here.
