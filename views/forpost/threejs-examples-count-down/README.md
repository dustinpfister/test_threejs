# threejs-examples-count-down

The goal with this threejs project example is to start a javaScript module that helps me to make count down timer video projects. There is a number of ideas that come to mind when it comes to this kind of project, but I started with a system where I create source objects for each number, for each digit of a count down display. That is that each digit group contains 10 mesh objects each of which represents a base 10 digit. I then use the Object3d visible boolean to switch the visibility of all but one mesh, for each digit depending on the current time string to set.
