# threejs-face3-color

This is what I have for my post on [face3 color](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/06/03/threejs-face3-color/). Also sense this is now a removed feature in late versions of threejs I have also added at least one example thus far that helps to get a similar result using the buffer geometry class.
