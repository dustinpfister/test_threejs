# threejs-face3

These are the source code examples for [my post on the old Face3 constructor in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/05/11/threejs-face3/). The last version of threejs in which I tested out my source code examples on Face3 was r111, with new versions of threejs the groups array of a geometry is what to use not to set up or change material index values for a geometry.
