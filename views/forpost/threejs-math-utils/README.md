The Math utils object is packed with a lot of useful methods for working out various things when working on a threejs project. For example there are methods for clamping a value to a given range, as well as converting degrees to radian values. This is then a collection of source code examples that I am writing about in my [blog post on this specific math utils object](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/04/11/threejs-math-utils/) in the javaScript library.
