# threejs-object3d-position todo list

## () sx-clone
* more advanced example of s3-rotation but now have two or more clones of a bash group

## () sx-rotation
* more advanced example of the s2-children example but using rotation also

## () sx-svg-movement
* () start an svg-path section using my threejs example module code for this

## () sx-curve-class
* () start a curve class section

## () sx-raycaster section
* () start a raycaster section with at least one basic example with say a torus geometry
* () start an exmaple that involves the use of the buffer geometry loader and a custom geometry with werid values
* () at least a basic menu example

## () sx-box3 section
* () use box3 to set an area where mesh objects can be
* () use box3 to make it so the position of objects will not go below a plane

## () sx-wrap-clamp section
* () animation involving the use of clamp
* () animation involving wrap

## () sx-ani-stochastic section
* () start a section for stochastic animation examples

## () expand basic even more
* () s1-6-apply-euler

## () s4-x-loop-world-local
* () this will be an animation in which I have two groups
* () the two groups will be in motion
* () the children of both groups will be in motion
* () I will then have at least one 'free' mesh that is just a child of scene
* () use the getWorldPositon method to get the world space location of a current group
* () move the mesh object to a location relative to groups, children of groups, and the scene object

## () s5-2-video-showcase
* () new video that showcases more about setting the position of objects
* () have more than one video file, or make a longer than normal video

## () s5-1-video-first
* () start new section on the source code of video projects for this post
* () new example based on the source code for video1 in videoground-blog-posts
