# threejs-object3d-position

The position property of the Object3d class is an instance of Vector3, and can be used to set the location of the object in 3d space. Sense the Object3d class is a base class for Mesh objects, Cameras, and Lights just to name a few objects, once one gains an understanding of how to use this property they can learn how to set the position of just about everything in a threejs project at least when it comes to objects rather than custom geometry.
