# threejs-object3d-position

The [position property of the Object3d class](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/04/04/threejs-object3d-position/) is an instance of Vector3, and can be used to set the location of the object in 3d space. Sense the Object3d class is a base class for Mesh objects, Cameras, and Lights just to name a few objects, once one gains an understanding of how to use this property they can learn how to set the position of just about everything in a threejs project at least when it comes to objects rather than custom geometry.
