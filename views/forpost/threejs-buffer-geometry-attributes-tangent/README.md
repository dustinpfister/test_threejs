## This one might prove to be a bit of a rabbit hole

There are a bunch of additional things that I will need to look into more, even for just a basic example it would seem.

* normal maps
* The computeMikkTSpaceTangents of the buffer geometry utils
* using tangent space or object space normal mapping

### 3dkingdoms - normal map type

Looks like this can turn int a full blown rabbit hole if I let it turn into one. There are a lot of these with threejs, but yes the use of this tangent attribute does seem to very much go hand in hand with normal maps
