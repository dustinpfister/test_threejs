# threejs-examples-curves-module todo list


## () r1-3-create-geo
* () start a demo in which I am createing geometry over time

## () r1-3-dynamic-get-alpha
* () start a demo where I call a method that will return a get alpha method that will have a state object attached
* () the state object can just be a property of the get alpha function
* () The state object can contain what get alpha method to use to begin with
* () the state object can contain options to use with one or more get alpha methods
* () There can be a trasiaitonal get alpha method that can be used to slowing change from one to another

## () r1-1-debug-alpha demo
* () start a new demo that has to do with looking at other get alpha methods

## () curves.js - r1 - Better get alpha methods, create geometry wityh curves
* (done) have a main curveMod.getAlphaFunction method to create an array of get alpha functions
* (done) make the two options for creating a curve alpha function the first two 'type' options for curveMod.getAlphaFunction
* (done) when calling a get alpha function I should be able to use it with one, two or three arguments


* () have a single debug method that will work with arrays or curves and will return points or lines
* () have a number of methods to choose from that will return a get alpha method
* () when making the get alpha methods, I have attach a state object to the function which can be used to tweak the get alpha over time
* () at least one method that has to do with createing geometry with curves

## ( done 11/18/2022 ) r0-x-qbalpha clean up
* (done) remove code that has to do more with the debug method

## ( done 11/17/2022 ) r0-3-qbalpha demo
* (done) start a demo of the alpha method
* (done) make a debug method for this
* (done) use built in form of get alpha method as well as the debug method

## ( done 11/17/2022 ) r0-2-qbcurvepath demo
* (done) demo of the qbcurvepath method

## ( done 11/17/2022 ) curvesjs - r0
* (done) have a common private helper used by both curveMod.QBCurvePath and curveMod.QBV3Array
* (done) have a curveMod.QBCurvePath method
* (done) build in the get alpha method
* (done) build in a debug method for the get alpha method

## ( done 11/17/2022 ) - start for post folder
* (done) for post folder started
