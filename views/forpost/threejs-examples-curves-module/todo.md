## () r1-2-dynamic-get-alpha
* () start a demo where I call a method that will return a get alpha method that will have a state object attached
* () the state object can just be a property of the get alpha function
* () The state object can contain what get alpha method to use to begin with
* () the state object can contain options to use with one or more get alpha methods
* () There can be a trasiaitonal get alpha method that can be used to slowing change from one to another

## () r1-1-create-geo
* () start a demo in which I am createing geometry over time

## () curvesjs - r1 - Better get alpha methods, create geometry wityh curves
* () have a number of methods to choose from that will return a get alpha method
* () when making the get alpha methods, I have attach a state object to the function which can be used to tweak the get alpha over time
* () at least one method that has to do with createing geometry with curves
