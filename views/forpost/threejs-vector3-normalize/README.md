# threejs-vector3-normalize

This is what I have together in terms of source code examples for my [post on the normalize method in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/14/threejs-vector3-normalize/). This normalize method will set the vector unit length to 1, while preserving the original direction of the vector. Sense the vectors unit length is one this allows for a good starting point to then use a method like the multiply scalar method to move the vector to any posiiton along the direction of a vector.
