# for post folder todo list

This is what I am currently planing out when it comes to creating for post folders for my posts on threejs. Each time I create a new post on threejs I should start a folder here that will contain the final examples that will be included in the post. I am also creating for post folders for each older post on threejs as I log more time editing my older content on threejs where the various source code examples are littered about in the demos folder. This is not a replacement for the demos folder though, that is a kind of drafting area with various things, where this is the final product.


# Start new for post folders for older posts

I should start making for post folders for older posts as part of the process of editing older content. Traffic, or at least potential traffic, should be a major deciding factor as to which posts get top priotiry when it comes to this.
