# threejs-material-loader

This is what I have in terms of demos and notes for my blog post on the material loader in threejs. At the time of this writing I have been logging a lot of time into expanding my post on materials in general into a deep dive kind of content piece and as such while I am at it, it does very much make sense to also write some new content pieces on the subject of materials to link to from that post and vis versa. 

## THREEJS DOCS AND SOURCE CODE

The first and foremost resources for doing research on this topic as always is the threejs docs, and after that reading the actual source code files when it comes to auditing code. With that said there is not just looking at the source code of the Material loader, but also the base loader class from which the material loader extends from.
