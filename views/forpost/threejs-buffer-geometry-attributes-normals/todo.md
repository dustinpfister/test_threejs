<!-- BASIC SECTION -->

## () s1-2-basic-vertex-order
* () I want to make a demo where the focus is on vertex order of the position attribute
* () I will want to make a number of triangles where each point has the same posiiton, but the order will differ for each
* () have normals for these also
* () the goal here is to make it clear that normals are just used for shading
