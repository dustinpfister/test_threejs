# threejs-buffer-geometry-set-from-points

These are a few demos for my blog post on the [set from points method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2023/01/05/threejs-buffer-geometry-set-from-points/) of the buffer geometry class. This set from points method is useful for creating a buffer geometry from an array of vector3 class objects. However it is not a good idea to update a geometry over and over again with this kind of method. So on top of just a few basic examples of the set from points method it is also called for to create a few more examples that have to do with buffer geometry in general as well.
