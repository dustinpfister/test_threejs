<!-- CURVES SECTION -->

## s4-1-curves-line
* () line curve demo using tube geometry, and just a line curve 3

## s4-2-curves-cubic
* () line curve demo using tube geometry, but now a qubic curve

## s4-3-curves-path
* () line curve demo using tube geometry, now with a curve path


<!-- BASIC SECTION -->

## s1-2-basic-lines
* () have a lines demo of set from points

<!-- DONE -->

## ( done 02/08/2023 ) s3-1-position-sphere
* (done) position attribite example in which I am not using set from points to update
* (done) create an array of vector3 objects
* (done) create new buffer geometry from a points array
* (done) this example will involve an app loop
* (done) update a buffer geometry with a points array

## ( done 01/05/2023 ) start new basic section
* (done) the current basic section is not so basic, rename the examples to to s2-\(n\)-mesh-\(subname\)
* (done) start a new s1-1-basic-points demo

## ( done 01/04/2023 ) s1-3-basic-mesh-uv
* (done) continue from s1-2-basic-mesh
* (done) add uv attribute
* (done) add light source
* (done) add canvas texture
* (done) use phong matreial

## ( done 01/04/2023 ) s1-2-basic-mesh
* (done) start an example where the goal will be to make a geometry for a mesh object
* (done) use just 4 points in space
* (done) create an index for the points
* (done) create a normal attribute
* (done) just use normal material for now

## ( done 01/04/2023 ) - for post folder
