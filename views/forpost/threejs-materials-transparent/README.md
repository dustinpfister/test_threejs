# threejs-materials-transparent

This is the current standing collection of examples that have to do with [using the transparent property as well as other features of a material in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/21/threejs-materials-transparent/). The transparent property alone contains a boolen value and is just used as a way to turn this feature on and off. After that there is the opacity property that can be used to set the global transparency of the over all material. In addtional to this there is also the use of alpha maps, in conjunciton with uv mapping as a way to define differing opacity values.
