# threejs-examples-backyard

This is what I have together in terms of the source code for my [threejs example that is a kind of backyard scene](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/07/threejs-examples-backyard/). What is cool about this example is that it is the first project that is more of a sum of other projects rather than just one single project, as I am using a lot of threejs features in this example actually. The background is a skybox that is making use of a cube texture, speaking of textures I am also using canvas elements to create textures for this example also. Many of the models that show up in this example are themselves other projects that I started and wrote about in other various posts.
