# threejs-vector3

This is what I have together thus far for source code examples that I am writing about in my [blog post on the Vector3 class in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/15/threejs-vector3/). The Vector3 class will come up a lot when working with the various features of threejs, for example when it comes to changing the position of a Mesh, Camera, or any kind of object based off of the Object3d class the position property of these objects is used, and that is an instance of the Vector3 class.
