# threejs-examples-aplerp todo list

## () - r1 - apLerp.load, more built in get alpha methods
* ( done) start r1 of the aplerp.js module
* () have a apLerp.load method as a way to load custom getAlpha methods
* () more built in get alpha methods
* () s2-1-add-sin example that translates from each point using a sin wave

## () - r0 - core of idea working okay
* ( done ) start r0 of the aplerp.js module
* ( done) have a getPointsBetween method that returns an array of vector3 class instances
* ( done ) have a state.p value that is the proper i / len value for this
* ( done ) simp built in can now just return state.p
* (done) have a s1-1-basic demo that uses the two built in simp and pow1 getAlpha methods

* () have an apLerp.lerp method that is like vector3 lerp
* () intreal apLerp method shared between apLerp.lerp and apLerp.getPointsBetween

* () have a s1-2-pow example in which I am playing with the base and e values for a collection of points

* () have a s1-3-parabola example in the form of a function in main.js
* () have a s1-4-sin example in the form of a function in main.js
