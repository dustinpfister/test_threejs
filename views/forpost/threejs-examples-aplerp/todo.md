# threejs-examples-aplerp todo list

## () - r1 - apLerp.load, more built in get alpha methods
* () start r1 of the aplerp.js module
* () have a apLerp.load method as a way to load custom getAlpha methods
* () more built in get alpha methods
* () s2-1-add-sin example that translates from each point using a sin wave

## ( done 09/06/2023 ) - r146 style update
* (done) update all demos to r146 style

## ( done 07/28/2022 ) - r0 - core of idea working okay
* (done) start r0 of the aplerp.js module
* (done) have a getPointsBetween method that returns an array of vector3 class instances
* (done) have a state.p value that is the proper i / len value for this
* (done) simp built in can now just return state.p
* (done) have a s1-1-basic demo that uses the two built in simp and pow1 getAlpha methods
* (done) have an apLerp.lerp method that is like vector3 lerp
* (done) intreal apLerp method shared between apLerp.lerp and apLerp.getPointsBetween
* (done) test out apLerp.lerp in s1-basic example
* (done) have a s1-2-pow example in which I am playing with the base and e values for a collection of points
* (done) have a s1-3-parabola example in the form of a function in main.js
* (done) have a s1-4-sin example in the form of a function in main.js
* (done) add makeSphereGroup helper as public method to aplerp module
* (done) sin example creates a collection of sphere groups
* (done) have all s1 examples be a static scene, aka loose orbit controls and app loop
* (done) update all sections to use apLerp.makeSphereGroup
