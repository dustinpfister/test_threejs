* () start a loop example based on the code of the s2-2-curvepath-update example
* () I will want a group of these kinds of mesh objects
* () switch to phong material
* () use texture

## ( done 06/02/2023 ) s2-2-curvepath-update
* (done) start a loop example based on the code of the s2-1-curvepath example
* (done) see about updating the curve children of the curve path
* (done) I will then also need to update the geometry of the tube as well

## ( done 06/02/2023 ) s1-2-basic-texture
* (done) use the basic material
* (done) canvas texture for the map option

## ( done 06/02/2023 ) s2-1-curvepath
* (done) I would like to have four cubic bezier curves for the path
* (done) have the curve path form a circle, but then move the control points sround from that a little

## ( done 06/02/2023 ) - s1-1-basic
* (done) use a quadratic bezier curve
