* () start a loop example based on the code of the s2-2-curvepath-update example
* () I will want a group of these kinds of mesh objects
* () switch to phong material
* () use texture

## () s2-2-curvepath-update
* () start a loop example based on the code of the s2-1-curvepath example
* () see about updating the curve children of the curve path
