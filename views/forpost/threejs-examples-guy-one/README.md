# threejs-examples-guy-one

A few years ago in 2018 I made a simple model of a guy in threejs, if it can be called that to begin with that is. When I started this project I made a separate repository to store the source code for this that can be [found here on github at my threejs guy repository](https://github.com/dustinpfister/threejs_guy). More recently in 2021 I started a [blog post on this project](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/29/threejs-examples-guy-one/), and as such now and then I will end up coming around to edit that post and maybe also expand on this a little once in a while. So then I started this for post folder as a place to park the current set of demos for it, and also a copy of what I worked out in my threejs guy repository.

## Making improvements to the guy model

I am going to want to draft some ideas out in the todo list here, but I am thinking that I should also update the old threejs guy repo when making some chances also.
