# threejs-userdata

For [my post on the subject of the user data object](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/02/16/threejs-userdata/) of objects based off of the object3d class in threejs I put together a few source code examples that make use of this feature. This use data object as the name suggest is where a developer can place some user defined data for an object and do so in a way in which there is no chance if messing up anything that threejs would use.
