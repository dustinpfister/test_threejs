# vector3-distance-to

I have a collection of examples here that make use of the distance to method as well as other features such as the length method to get a distance between two points of interest. These examples are what I am [writing about in detail for my blog post on the distance to method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/15/threejs-vector3-distance-to/) in the Vector3 class of the threejs javaScript library.
