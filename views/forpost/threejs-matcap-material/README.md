### StackOverflow - the color of meshmatcapmaterial looks very light

This popped up when searching just "threejs matcap material". The post brought up that like always there are a few texture object properties that I will want to tweak when making a map for this kind of material. An accepted answer for this suggested to set the encoding property of the texture used which has now been replaced with the color space property.

### Mozilla - CanvasRenderingContext2D

The Mozilla Docs on the use of the create Radial Gradient are a helpful way to refresh with this one as always.
