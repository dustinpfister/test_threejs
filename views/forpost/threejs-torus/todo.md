# threejs-torus todo list

<!-- S1 - BASIC SECTION -->

<!-- S2 - POINTS SECTION -->

<!-- S3 - GROUP SECTION -->

<!-- S4 - LATHE SECTION -->

I would like to have a section in which I write a thing or two about late geoetry and how that can be used to make a torus shape. Also it can be used to make all kinds of other shapes like that as well of course.

## ( ) - s4-2-lathe-half
* () have a half tous shape demo

## ( ) - s4-3-lathe-sin
* () use Math.sin to get a weird circle like curve to use

<!-- DONE -->

## ( done 07/18/2023 ) s4-1-lathe-torus
* (done) basic example of lathe geometry in which I make a torus like shape

## ( done 07/18/2023 ) - spelling
* (done) use spelling of 'doughnut' in place of 'donut'

## ( done 03/22/2023 ) - update to r146 style
* (done) rename folders
* (done) update demos to r146 style

## ( done 09/19/2022 ) - s2-2-points-mesh-for-every
* (done) example where I make a mesh object using sphere geometry for every point in a torus geometry

## ( done 09/19/2022 ) - s3-points
* (done) have a points example

## ( done 09/19/2022 ) - s1-2-geo-copy
* (done) start a basic loop example in which I update a torus geometry with an additional torus geometry

## ( done 09/19/2022 ) - For post folder started with demo exmaples
* (done) For post folder started with examples from r127 demo folder
