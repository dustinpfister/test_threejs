# threejs-multiply-scalar

The [multiply scalar method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/03/23/threejs-vector3-multiply-scalar/) in the Vector3 class of threejs is one or many useful methods in that class than come in handy when figuring out how to position objects. The method can just be called off of any instance of vector3 as a way to adjusted the length of the vector. However I typical use the method in combination with many other methods such as copy, normalize, and add just to name a few usual suspect methods.
