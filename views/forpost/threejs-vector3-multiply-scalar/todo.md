# threejs-vector3-multiply-scalar todo list

## () - s2-3-copy-curve
* () have an example that involves the use of a curve
* () use the get point method to get a Vector3 along the curve
* () use the copy method to copy the position of a green mesh to that point
* () create a few white mesh objects and copy the curve point for that as well
* () however add a new vector in using multiply scalar

## ( done 03/14/2023 ) - s3-2-loop-move-many-along
* (done) start a video2 loop example
* (done) video2 can just be a bunch of mesh objects that move in and out from the origin

## ( done 03/14/2023 ) new s1-2-basic-normalize
* (done) new basic example that uses the length method to check the unit length of the vector
* (done) I will also what to use normalize in this demo

## ( done 03/14/2023 ) rename folders, 146 style
* (done) rename demo folders
* (done) quick update to r146 style

## ( done 09/08/2022 ) - changing direction and scale of vectors
* (done) animation loop example that shows use of applyEuler along with multiply scalar

## ( done 03/23/2022 ) - copy, translate, normalize, and multiply-scalar
* (done) example that uses translate on top of copy and normailze

## ( done 03/23/2022 ) - copy, normalize and multiply-scalar
* (done) have one mesh that is positioned using copy, normalize, and multiply sclar

## ( done 03/23/2022 ) - basic example
* (done) start with a basic static example of multiply-scalar
