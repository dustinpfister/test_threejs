# object grid wrap

What I want to do with this project is create a system where I have an array of objects, and then a grid of index values for what kind of object to place at a grid location. I would also like to have it so that the locations of objects will change with a given position in such a way that objects will wrap around. This is then I kind of [object grid wrap module project](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/05/20/threejs-examples-object-grid-wrap/) to which I have wrote one of my many threejs examples posts on.
