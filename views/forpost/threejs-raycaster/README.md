# threejs-raycaster

This is what I have for my [post on the raycaster class in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/18/threejs-raycaster/). This class is useful if I find myself in a situation in which I need to click a mesh object. There are a whole lot of other use cases on top of that as well as I can also use it as a means to find out if any mesh objects are along a given ray in space in general as well.
