# stochastic-basic

The aim her is to have a simple start point for projects in which I want to be able to change a few things by way of some user input. The only main way that I would change things with this template is to use an interface that when clicked will change the value of one or more alpha values for the animation loop. On top of that is orbit controls are there to work with I can also click and drag outside of the user interface to move the camera around.
