  <!-- Not so good CSS, in fact was not working at all because it did not pass false when calling the setSize method
       of the renderer which results in style being appended that will override what is set here. Fixed that and also
       changed up the CSS so that it will not result in a situation in which I will have to scroll when I do get it working

    body { margin: 0; }
    canvas{ 
       width: 50%;
       margin-right: auto;

      First off ChatGPT used a CDN, maybe that is not always such a bad thing, but I prefer to use my own locally hosed assets 
      for a long list of reasons that I do not care to get into detail with here.
      The other problem is that used an out dated version of threejs (R119) and a whole lot has changed sense that release.
      For now I will keep the CDN link, but will at least update to R148 which as the current revision when I asked GPT this

    // I like to block together the core objects of a threejs project together at the very top like this
    // It was using var rather than const and let. Not to big of a deal for me at least but it has been a while
    // now snese ES2015 spec javaScript came out.
    const WIDTH = 400, HEIGHT = 300;
    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
    const FOV = 50, NEAR = 0.1, FAR = 1000; // added Field Of View
    const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(FOV, WIDTH / HEIGHT, NEAR, FAR);
    camera.position.z = 150; // set this at 300, halted it to 150 to get a closer view of the sphere
    const renderer = new THREE.WebGL1Renderer(); // using webGL1 Renderer so that I do not get errors on RPI OS
    renderer.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT, false);      // added false when calling set size so that canvas CSS will work

    const RADIUS = 50,SEGMENTS = 16, RINGS = 16;

    const sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(RADIUS, SEGMENTS, RINGS);
    // CHAT GPT went with the Lambert Material But I think A good starting point
    // is to go with the Normal Material as that does not require a light source which helps to reduce complexity
    // for people that are new to threejs
    const sphereMaterial = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();
    const sphere = new THREE.Mesh( sphereGeometry, sphereMaterial);
