# threejs-getting-started

This is what I have together for source code examples that I aim t write about in [my getting started with threejs post](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/). When it comes to first starting out with threejs the very first thing that I wanted to do is to just have that simple static box example up and running. So the of course the first main source code example that I have here is just that, a very simple hello world style example that is just a single fixed image of a view of a cube.
