# threejs-wireframe

These are the source code examples that I have together for my [post on the subject of wire frames in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/12/19/threejs-wireframe/). There are a lot of mesh materials in the library that allow for setting the material in a wire frame mode by just setting a boolean to true when creating the material. There are a number of other related options to this boolean value but many of them will not work on all platforms, same as with lines.

</div>

Speaking of lines that is one way to go about having an alternatives to material wire frames. There are also a lot of other ways to get a kind of wire frame like look using textures and so fort as well.
