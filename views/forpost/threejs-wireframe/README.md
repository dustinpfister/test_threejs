# threejs-wireframe

These are the source code examples that I have together for my [post on the subject of wire frames in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/12/19/threejs-wireframe/). There are a lot of mesh materials in the library that allow for setting the material in a wire frame mode by just setting a boolean to true when creating the material. There are a number of other related options to this boolean value but many of them will not work on all platforms, same as with lines.

Speaking of lines that is one way to go about having an alternatives to material wire frames. There are also a lot of other ways to get a kind of wire frame like look using textures and so fort as well.
