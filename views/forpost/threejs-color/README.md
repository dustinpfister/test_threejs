# threejs-color

A few examples of the THREE.Color constructor function in threejs for [my blog post on this specific topic](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/03/threejs-color/). The color class is great not just for making color objects to use with material options, but also to just work with color in general. A color object can be used to set the color option of a mesh material, but it can also come in handy when working out some javaScript code to create a canvas texture or something to that effect as well.
