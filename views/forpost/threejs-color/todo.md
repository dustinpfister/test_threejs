<!-- LOOP SECTION -->

## () - s7-2-loop-setfromvector3
* () start with the source for for the methods section
* () see about working out new logic where both direciton and unit length have effect

<!-- VERTEX COLOR SECTION -->

## () - sx-1-vertexcolors
* () new basic example of vertex colors
* () just use vertex colors for a built in geometry


<!-- BASIC SECTION -->

<!-- METHODS SECTION -->

## () - s5-3-methods-getstyle
* () I should have a stand alone get style demo

## () - s5-4-methods-lerp
* () I think it would be cool to make this a vertex color demo
* () have two sets of colors and lerp between the two
* () I will want to do so by diretcly updateing the color attribuite

<!-- DONE -->

## ( done 07/01/2023 ) - s5-2-methods-setfromvector3
* (done) this might need to be a loop demo
* (done) this is a method that was added in r151, if I am sticking with r146 I will need to have a pony fill
* (done) looks like this method does not normalize so Is hould do that

## ( done 07/01/2023 ) - consolidate demos
* (done) s2 and s3 can be consolidated into a new materials section
* (done) s8 can be part of a new texture section
* (done) background, methods, random, and loop sections

## ( done 02/08/2023 ) - expand basic section
* (done) rename s1-basic to s1-1-basic-material-color
* (done) new s1-2-basic-lines example

## ( done 02/08/2023 ) - update to r146 style
* (done) use r146 for all demos
* (done) update current set of examples to r146 code style

## ( done 07/20/2022 ) - s8-data-textures
* (done) have an example that makes use of data textures and THREE.Color as a way to set the colors of a texture

## ( done 05/12/2022 ) - new s6-color-change
* (done) have an example in which I am changing the state of a THREE.Color instance over time
* (done) rename s6-color-add-sub to s7-color-add-sub

## ( done 02/19/2022 ) - add and subtract example
