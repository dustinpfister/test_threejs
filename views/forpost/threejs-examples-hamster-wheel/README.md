# threejs-examples-hamster-wheel

This is another one of my three.js models, this one is of a hamster wheel and on top of that I also thought it would be cool to add my guy one model to the over all scene as well. Like my many other examples that I have in this for post folder I also wrote a [blog post on the source code here](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/19/threejs-examples-hamster-wheel/) in which I write about what I have hear in greater detail.
