# threejs-export-webm-whammy

As of this writing I do not have anything here for this post, and that may not change in the future. Because of code breaking changes that happened in browsers, and the fact that whammy is not being maintained.

## Ideas for possible future edits

Whammy itself is dead, but the process of exporting to video is not. I can just write more on other ways to do the same thing in more modern browser environments. I think the base way to have control over this though might be more in line with electionjs projects as that is how I am doing this these days. Also there is writing more posts on the subject of exporting in general as there is not just exporting video but also other kinds of assets from a threejs project.
