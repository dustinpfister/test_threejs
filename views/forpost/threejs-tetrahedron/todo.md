# threejs-terahedron todo list

## (  ) s2-x-position-custom2
* () have a function where I create a custom buffer geomerty with four points
* () have a prim vector3 that will be along the x axis
* () the other three vectors can conform to a radius
* () a length can be given that is the distance from prim and the other vectors
* () another argument can be used to adjust the rotaiton of the other vectors relative to x axis

## (  ) s2-3-position-custom1
* () have a custom buffer geo function that wil create a buffer geometry with any four Vector3 objects

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) s2-1-position-distance
* (done) start a section where I am taking a look at the position attributes of terahedron like geometry
* (done) use the distanceTo Vector3 class method to compare distances of all edges

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) s1-3-cylinder
* (done) see about making one with the cylinder geometry

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) s1-2-cone
* (done) using the cone geometry to make one

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) s1-1-basic
* (done) basic static example of THREE.TetrahedronGeometry

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) - for post started
* (done) for post folder started with the r146 demo folder
