## () s2-1-position-distance
* () start a section where I am taking a look at the position attributes of terahedron like geometry
* () this first one should involve the terahedron geometry
* () use the distanceTo Vector3 class method to compare distances of all edges

* (done) see about making one with the cylinder geometry

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) s1-2-cone
* (done) using the cone geometry to make one

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) s1-1-basic
* (done) basic static example of THREE.TetrahedronGeometry

## ( done 12/01/2022 ) - for post started
