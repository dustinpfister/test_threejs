# threejs-capsule-geometry

## () s3 - loop example
* (done) see about starting an animation loop example based off of the s2-group example
* (done) I might want to have a standard capsule geo and then just set scale, pos, and rotation as needed
* () have a helper function of cretaing a group of mesh objects
* () have a helper function for updating object3d props with a set of vectors
* () have the animation loop with mutation of vectors


## ( done 07/21/2022 ) s2 - group
* (done) start an example that is a group of mesh objects that use the capsule geometry 
* (done) have a few Vector3 instances
* (done) use the distance between the vector3 class instances to set the length of capsule geometry
* (done) see about using the lookAt method to set the rotation of each mesh

## ( done 07/21/2022 ) - basic example done
* (done) have a nice basic example done
