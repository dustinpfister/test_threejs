# threejs-capsule-geometry

## () - s1-2-basic-sphere
* () basic example in which I make a sphere like geometry
* () looks like when I set the length to 1/10th the radius this works well

## ( done 02/16/2023 ) - r146 style
* (done) update all current examples to r146 style

## ( done 02/16/2023 ) rename folders
* (done) rename folders to follow the pattern that I am using now

## ( done 07/22/2022 ) s3 - loop example
* (done) see about starting an animation loop example based off of the s2-group example
* (done) I might want to have a standard capsule geo and then just set scale, pos, and rotation as needed
* (done) have a helper function of cretaing a group of mesh objects
* (done) have a helper function for updating object3d props with a set of vectors
* (done) have the animation loop with mutation of vectors
* (done) I will want to have a way to lerp one set of vectors to another set

## ( done 07/21/2022 ) s2 - group
* (done) start an example that is a group of mesh objects that use the capsule geometry 
* (done) have a few Vector3 instances
* (done) use the distance between the vector3 class instances to set the length of capsule geometry
* (done) see about using the lookAt method to set the rotation of each mesh

## ( done 07/21/2022 ) - basic example done
* (done) have a nice basic example done
