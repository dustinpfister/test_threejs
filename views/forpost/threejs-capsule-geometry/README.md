# threejs-capsule-geometry

This is a few examples of the [capsule geometry construcor](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/07/22/threejs-capsule-geometry/) which is just one of many built in options for creating geometry by calling a constructor function. This kind of geometry constructor function extends from the lathe geometry which is another great option for making geometry that can be used to create the same kind of geometry as a capsule geometry constructor function but with greater flexibility.
