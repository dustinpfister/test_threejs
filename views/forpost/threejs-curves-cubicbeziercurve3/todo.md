## () s2-2-tracks-rotate
* () start a simple demo where I just check if I can mutate the vectors of a curve

## () s2-1-tracks
* (done) start an example where I have a few source object options
* (done) each source object is a group with a mesh
* (done) a curve can be set to the userData object of the group of a source object
* (done) the curve of a tack object can be used with the get get world position method of the group to create a curve path
* (done) the curve path can funciton as a track by moving a mesh object that will be a train along the curve path
* (done) create a whole bunch clones of these source objects to create a track
* (done) I will want a helper method for creating track objects from source objects
* (done) array of data for making track objects

## ( done 02/09/2023 ) s1-3-basic-object-position
* (done) basic example where a curve is used to position objects

## ( done 02/09/2023 ) s1-2-basic-curvepaths
* (done) a path of these curves example

## ( done 02/09/2023 ) - for post folder started
* (done) for post folder started with the r146 demo as the first basic example
