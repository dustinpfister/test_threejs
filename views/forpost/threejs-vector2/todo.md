## ( done 06/10/2023 ) - s2-2-methods-multiplyscalar
* (done) create a shape and use it with extrude geometry
* (done) use Math.cos, Math.sin, and a static radius value to get x and y values to use with Vector2.set
* (done) use multiply scalar to adjust unit length back and forth
* (done) use Math.sin for the values to use with multiply scalar

## ( done 06/10/2023 ) - s2-1-methods-clone
