# threejs-vector2 todo list


<!-- UVMAPPING -->

## () - sx-1-uvmapping
* () section on the use of Vector2 to helo work out custom uv mapping
* () use canvas elements to display a scaled down image of the texture, and have points and lines over the texture

<!-- RAYCASTER -->

## () - sx-1-raycaster
* () Start a section on the Vector2 class and the use of it with raycaster
* () just start this with an example from the main post on raycaster

<!-- Curve Alpha Section -->

## () - sx-1-alphas-curve
* () example uisng curve alphas and the vector2 class
* () if I am going to start a seciton on this I would start with a copy of the s5-1-alphas demo from threejs-curve

## () - sx-2-alpha-v2array
* () start a v2array get alpha method
* () the x value of each vector can be a 0-1 range on the alpha-chart
* () the y value of each vector can be used to set what the return value should be of the git alpha
* () I think I would like to make it so that the given array is normalized so that any v2 array can be used

<!-- METHODS SECTION -->

## () - s2-5-methods-distanceto 

## () - s2-4-methods-lerp

## () - s2-3-methods-normalize 

<!-- EXPAND BASIC SECTION -->

## () - s1-3-basic-shape
* () have a shape example
* () use the extrude geometry with the shape

<!-- DONE -->

## ( done 06/10/2023 ) - s2-2-methods-multiplyscalar
* (done) create a shape and use it with extrude geometry
* (done) use Math.cos, Math.sin, and a static radius value to get x and y values to use with Vector2.set
* (done) use multiply scalar to adjust unit length back and forth
* (done) use Math.sin for the values to use with multiply scalar

## ( done 06/10/2023 ) - s2-1-methods-clone
* (done) create a path by having a point follow a curve, and have another point that is cloned from that point

## ( done 06/08/2023 ) - s1-2-basic-curve2d
* (done) start a basic 2d curve example
* (done) this can also be a lathe geometry example

## ( done 06/08/2023 ) - s1-1-basic-lathe
* (done) first basic example on the lathe geometry
