# threejs-vector2

The Vector2 class in threejs is used to create objects that are used for 2d points in space. The class has a wide range of prototype methods that can prove to be useful for various tasks that have to do with such points. Also when it seems to be lacking it is not such a bad class to extend when I want to add some custom methods on top of this when need be. There are a number of other vector classes in threejs such as Vector3 that will help with 3d points in space, and vector3 that comes into play when doing things with features of threejs such as quaternion objects.
