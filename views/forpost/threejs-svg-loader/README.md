# threejs-svg-loader

The svg loader that can be found in the examples folder of the threejs repo is a way to quickly load svg graphics and then quickly create a 2d shape with the data from one ore more avg files. I thought that it would then be a good idea to create one or more examples of the svg loader, along with other treejs features such as the Shape constructor and write a blog post on this subject.
