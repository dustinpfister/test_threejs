# threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position

Source code examples for my blog post on the [position attribute of a buffer geometry instance](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/07/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position/). The position attribute is what I would want to set up first when making a custom geometry from the ground up. Another way to learn a thing or two about this would be to mutate the state of a position attribute that was all ready set up with a position attribute. For example there is just using one of the built in geometry constrictors such as the Box or Sphere geometry constrictors and then playing around with the vales of the position attributes that are created by these constructors.
