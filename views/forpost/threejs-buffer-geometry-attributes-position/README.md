# threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position

These are the source code examples for my blog post on the [position attribute of a buffer geometry instance](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/07/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position/). The position attribute is what I would want to set up first when making a custom geometry from the ground up. 

Another way to learn a thing or two about this would be to mutate the state of a position attribute that was all ready set up with a position attribute. For example there is just using one of the built in geometry constrictors such as the Box or Sphere geometry constrictors and then playing around with the vales of the position attributes that are created by these constructors.

## Future Edits

Sense this blog post seems to be getting more than the ushual amount of traction, and also just simply becuase of the interensic value, I will be putting a fair more than ushual amount of effort into editing and expanding this post.

## The Custom Triangle section ( basic section )

The starting basic section of this post has to do with just simply making a single triangle in space. This just seems like one of the best ways to get started with this a custom position attribute example. However when it comes to using THREE.points it is possible to have just a single vertex. Also I some times thing that a Tetrahedron might be the best example to start with.

## The Box Geometry Section

The general idea with this section is to have the focus on mutation of the position attribute of a geometry that was created with one of the built in geometry clases, rather than making one from the ground up.

## The v3array section

The Topic of this section is then to create a geometry from an array of Vector3 objects.

## The Curves Seciton

using curves as a tool to create an update a geometry

## The Loop Section

As with any other blog post here the focus is to just make some cool animaiton examples where the focus is on the position attribite of buffer geometry objects.
