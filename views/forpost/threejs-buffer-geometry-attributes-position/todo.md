# threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position todo list

## () sx-1-extends-lathegeometry
* () start a section on the subject of extending built in geometry, starting with lathe geometry

## () sx-1-curves-cubic-bezier
* () start an example where I create a curve to use as a way to create a position attribute

## ( done 05/09/2023 ) move files, r146 style
* (done) move js file to root of demo folders
* (done) r146 style

## ( done 10/06/2022 ) - s2-4-boxgeometry-nonindexed
* (done) start a n example where I pull apart a geometry that is non indexed and thus has an array size of 108.
* (done) have two mesh objects one indexed and the other not
* (done) see about break all the triangles out into space 

## ( done 10/05/2022 ) - s4-3-loop-boxgeometry-vert

* (done) update from v3array example

## ( done 09/28/2022 ) new basic section
* (done) start a new basic section that will be about making a geometry from the ground up.
* (done) for first demo just use the points constructor
* (done) have a mesh example and use compute vertex normals, and set clean defaults for uv attribute

## ( done 09/28/2022 ) clean up and combine examples
* (done) update all examples to use cont and let
