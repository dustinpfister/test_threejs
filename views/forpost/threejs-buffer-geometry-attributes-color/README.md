# threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-color

The color attribute of a buffer geometry instance is how to go about defining a color to use for each vertex in a position attribute of such a geometry. In other words it is a way to set a color for each point in space that will be used with a material that can be set into vertex color mode by setting the [vertexColors Boolean to true](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/Material.vertexColors). Sense the vertexColors boolen is a property of the base matreial class, this should work with just about all built in materials.
