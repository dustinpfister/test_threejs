# threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-color todo list

<!-- CUSOTM GEOMETRY SECTION -->

I might want to start a custom geometry section for this post. If so I think that it would be nice to write about rhw buffer geometry loader, and my vertex color trees as one such example.

<!-- MORPH ATTRIBUETS SECITON? -->

I might want to make a morph attributes section for this post. If so I will want to make it clear that you need WebGL 2 for that fetaure to work.

<!-- CUSOM SHADRERS SECTION? -->

## () sx-2-shaders-light
* () have a shader material that uses vertex colors along with light sources
* () make is so that light will effect the over all frag color

## () sx-1-shaders
* () have a starting example using the shader material
* () can start with the example I all ready have based on the basic material (see the shader material for post folder)

<!-- Expand BASIC SECTION -->

<!-- DONE -->

## ( done 06/21/2023 ) s1-4-basic-points

## ( done 01/18/2023 ) s1-3-basic-lines
* (done) example in which vertex colors are used with a line

## ( done 01/18/2023 ) s1-2-basic-materials
