# threejs-geometry

These are the source code files for my [post on the old THREE.Geometry constructor](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/14/threejs-geometry/) in threejs which is no longer part of the core of threejs as of r125+. In place of using the old Geometry constructor it is not advised to use the [Buffer Geometry constructor](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/04/22/threejs-buffer-geometry/) as a replacement for this.

## Needed Files

* threejs ( r91 - r111 )

## Videos for this post

none
