# threejs-examples-waves

Source code for my [waves threejs example](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/11/14/threejs-examples-waves/), along with demos. This was on eof the first threejs examples that I started way back in 2018 when I was using r98 of threejs. I sense then made an updated r0 of a module that was based on the source code from the first example that I made where not much was changed. However I then made an additional revision right away in which I started all over from the ground up with this one. The new r1 of the module has a position, normal, and UV attribute along with an index for the position attribute as well. I also added a whole bunch of options that I guess I will end up expanding on more if I do get around to make yet even another revision of this one at some point in the future,

## r1 of the wave module

R1 of the wave module was a complete redo of the source code from the ground up. The end result is a project that will work well with mesh objects, and also includes a bunch of options for adjusting various aspects of the waves.

## r0 of the wave module

The original project would just create an update a geometry that had a position attribute only. So it would not work with mesh objects, but would still be good enough for points which is demoed in this video here.
