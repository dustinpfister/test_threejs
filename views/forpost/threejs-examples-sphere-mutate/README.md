# threejs-examples-sphere-mutate

This is the source code that I have together for my blog post on a [sphere geometry mutation threejs example](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/10/threejs-examples-sphere-mutate/). This project started out as just a single main javaScript file, but as of r2 has progressed into a module form of the project. I now have a fairly decent system for mutating the position attribute of a buffer geometry that was created using the THREE.SphereGeometry constructor function in threejs that allows for me to quickly create functions that mutate points in a way in which vector unit length is changes while preserving the direction.
