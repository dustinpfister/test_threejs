This post aims to be just a general overview of the various features of this class that comes into play all of the time. The object3d class is not often used directly, however it is a base class of scene objects, and also every type of object that one would add to a scene object. This includes mesh objects, cameras, lights, and many more kinds of objects such as points, lines, and various helper objects. Learning a thing or two about the various properties and methods of this class is then a major part of become more fluid with the over all library then and one way to get a grasp on all of what there is to work with is to work out some quick examples of the various objuect3d class features.
