# threejs-fog

Here I have the source code examples for [my post on fog](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/16/threejs-fog/) in threejs. When choosing to use fog there are two constructors to choose from one of which is the [THREE.fog](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/scenes/Fog) that will add a linear fog, and the other is [THREE.FogExp2](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/scenes/FogExp2) which is a exponential squared fog. The fog object that is returned by one of these constructors then just needs to be added to the scene.fog property of a scene object, and then one will also want to set the background color of the scene object also.
