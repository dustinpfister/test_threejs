<!-- s1 - BASIC SECTION -->



<!-- s2 - VERTEX COLORS SECTION -->

<!-- s3 - CROSSHATCH SECTION -->

## () - sx-2-crosshatch-opacity
* () see about adding opacity for this


<!-- DONE -->

## ( done 07/18/2023 ) - backticks over arrays
* (done) use backticks over arrays for all basic demos

## ( done 01/13/2023 ) - s2-1-vertexcolors - vec2 for ratio
* (done) I should be able to define a vec2 for the ratio of base color to vertex color

## ( done 01/13/2023 ) - s2-1-vertexcolors - some changes
* (done) there should just be a uBasecolor and opacity value for uniforms
* (done) expand remaining #includes with the exception of 'common'

## ( done 01/13/2023 ) - s2-1-vertexcolors
* (done) start a section in which vertexcolors are used starting with a basic example
* (done) start with the mesh basic material GLSL code
* (done) create a color attribute for the geometry
* (done) remove code that does not have to do with vertex colors
* (done) have vertex colors just be part of what effects the over all diffuse color

## ( done 01/12/2023 ) - s1-3-basic-shader-chunk-code
* (done) same as s1-2-basic-shader-chunk but now I am using the shader code strings

## ( done 01/12/2023 ) - s1-2-basic-shader-chunk
* (done) basic example of the THREE.ShaderChunk object

## ( done 01/12/2023 ) - s1-1-basic-diffuse
* (done) make a very simply solid color shader like the basic material, only it is just a solid color only

## ( done 01/12/2023 ) start for post folder
* (done) for post folder started with r146 demo
