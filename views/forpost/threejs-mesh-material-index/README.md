# threejs-mesh-material-index

This is what I have together for my [post on the material index property](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/05/14/threejs-mesh-material-index/) of group objects of the groups property of buffer geometry in threejs. This is not to be confused with THREE.Group that is an Object3d class based object that is used to group objects together into one group of objects. The groups property is an array of objects that contain a material index value, and then values that are used to set a draw range to use that material with the given part of the geometry. In other words this is something that will come into play when using an array of materials rather than just one.
