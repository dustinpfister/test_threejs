# threejs-examples-house-2

A long time ago I started a threejs-examples post that is a crude house model example where I am making a simple house with javaScript code. Although I do still find myself making those kinds of objects with threejs once in a while I have say that more often than not I do not. These days I am more interested in making geometry in a program like that of blender, and then export from blender into a format that can then be imported into threejs by way of one of the many loader options. One such option is the DAE file format which thus far I seem to like to go with for now. So this example is now a whole other project where I am now making a simple house model this way, rather than just doing everything with javaScript code and hard coded data.
