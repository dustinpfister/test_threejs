# threejs-examples-dae-tools-sphere-normals-invert

The idea here is to start a project in which I am creating a sphere in blender with inverted normals so that when I load a DAE file export into a threejs project the 'front side' of the sphere is the inside of the sphere. On top of having inverted normals I can also work out one or more textures to use with this as well with the end goal of just having a few options for something that will work as a kind of background for an over all scene.
