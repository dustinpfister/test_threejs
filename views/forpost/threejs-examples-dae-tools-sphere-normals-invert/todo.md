<!-- !!! VERTEX ORDER ISSHUE !!! -->

When I first wrote this post I assumed that the normals attribute was used to set what side of a triangle is the front side, which is wrong. It case you have forgot it is the order of the points of a tringale in the position attribute, or index for that matter, that is used to set the sides. As such the source code, and text of this post might need a total work over.
