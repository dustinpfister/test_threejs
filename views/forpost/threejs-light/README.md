# threejs-light

These are the source code examples that I have together for my post on [light in general in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/02/25/threejs-light/). There are a few options for adding light to a scene, but for the most part there are only one or two options that I find myself using the most, mainly ambient light and directional light. Still sense this is a post on light options in general I think that I should have demos in which I cover all of the options to at least some extent. Also when it comes to any kind of basic section I am thinking that the focus should be on the basics of what a develop should know about in general with light, nit just with the light options, but also relevant topics that have to do with geometry and materials.
