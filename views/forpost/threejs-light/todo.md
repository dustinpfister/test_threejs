# threejs-light todo list

<!-- SHADOWS SECTION -->

If I even get to it I also might want to have a section on shadows

<!-- NOLIGHT SECTION -->

If I start a section on not using light the focus should be one the features of the MeshBasicMaterial. There is just using the map option then with this material, and focusing on the state of textures as a way to add depth. I should also have at least one demo n using vertex color attributes of geometry and getting that to work with the basic material.

<!-- BASICS SECTION -->

If I am going to start a basics section the focus should not just be one light options, but also on geometry and materials.

## sx-1-basic-materials
* () just use a built in option for geometry
* () go with phong material for the main mesh object
* () have both ambient and directional light

## sx-2-basic-geometry
* () custom geometry this time
* () have a position, normal, and uv attribute
* () canvas texture for map option of material used
* () ambient and directional light

<!-- RECT AREA SECTION -->

## () - sx-1-rectarea
* () just a basic example of this kind of light

<!-- SPOTLIGHT SECTION -->

## () sx-1-spotlight
* () spot light section

<!-- POINT AREA SECTION -->

## () s4-2-point-helper
* () I should have at least one dmeo on the point light helper

<!-- ANIMATION LOOP SECTION -->

## () s5-3-ani-pointlight
* () redu this demo to have it so that we have a collection of torus geometry mesh objects
* () have the point light move threw the holes in the torus geometry mesh objects
