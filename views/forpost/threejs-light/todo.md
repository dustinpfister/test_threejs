# threejs-light todo list

<!-- NOLIGHT SECTION -->

If I start a section on not using light the focus should be one the features of the MeshBasicMaterial. There is just using the map option then with this material, and focusing on the state of textures as a way to add depth. I should also have at least one demo n using vertex color attributes of geometry and getting that to work with the basic material.

<!-- BASICS SECTION -->

If I am going to start a basics section the focus should not just be one light options, but also on geometry and materials.

## sx-1-basic-materials
* () just use a built in option for geometry
* () go with phong material for the main mesh object
* () have both ambient and directional light

## sx-2-basic-geometry
* () custom geometry this time
* () have a position, normal, and uv attribute
* () canvas texture for map option of material used
* () ambient and directional light

<!-- RECT AREA SECTION -->

## () - sx-1-rectarea
* () just a basic example of this kind of light

<!-- POINT AREA SECTION -->

## () - sx-1-point
* () basic point light example
