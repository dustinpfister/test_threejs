# threejs-examples-audio-sample-alphas

What I want to have here is a way to load audio sample data exported from audacity in html file format. This audio data can then be used to create an array of alpha values that can then in turn be used as a way to update things with an animation on a frame by frame basis. So in other words this is a music visualization tool for threejs projects.


## Using DOM PARSER

For this project I am using the domParse to parse and html string into a document object that I can then work with using the various DOM methods.
