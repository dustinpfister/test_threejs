# threejs-materials todo list

<!-- MATERAL ARRAY SECTION -->

It would be nice to have a section where I get into material arrays, and groups of buffer geometry. If so I should have at least one demo in which I am using the Phong for metal surfaces, and Lambert for wood surfaces.

## sx-1-matarray-cube
* () a mesh that uses the cube geometry is a good start for this kind of subject as always
* () start with code from the mesh-material-index post if need be

## sx-2-matarray-plane
* () a mesh using a plane might be a good start when it comes to the add group method
* () see about making a custom one where we have an area that is a 'lake'
* () use the phong matreial for the lake area, and lambert for the rest

<!-- MeshMatcapMaterial -->

I should start a mesh matcap section when I have a post on this material option.

<!-- SHADER MATERIAL SECTION -->

## sx-1-shader-white
* () This will be a very basic hello word type example where I just have a blob of white area

<!-- TEXTURES SECTION -->

Start a textures section where the focus is on textures and the various map options of materials

<!-- BASE MATERIAL SECTION -->

## () - sx-2-common-vertexcolor
* () vertex color examples

<!-- BASIC SECTION -->

I should start a basic section in which I just have a few very simple examples of the use of materials

## s1-1-basic-meshnormal
* (done) very simple mesh normal material example
* () make the normal material for the mesh options section not so simple then
