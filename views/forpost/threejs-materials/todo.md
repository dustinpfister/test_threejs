<!-- BLENDING SECTION -->

At this time I do have one demo on the subject of blending and materials, but I can see that this is a subject that should have its own section. This is not a situation in which there are just a few constants for one property and that is it. Some of the constants for the blending property enabled other properties as well.

<!-- MATERAL ARRAY SECTION -->

It would be nice to have a section where I get into material arrays, and groups of buffer geometry. If so I should have at least one demo in which I am using the Phong for metal surfaces, and Lambert for wood surfaces.

## sx-1-matarray-cube
* () a mesh that uses the cube geometry is a good start for this kind of subject as always
* () start with code from the mesh-material-index post if need be

## sx-2-matarray-plane
* () a mesh using a plane might be a good start when it comes to the add group method
* () see about making a custom one where we have an area that is a 'lake'
* () use the phong matreial for the lake area, and lambert for the rest

<!-- MeshMatcapMaterial -->

I should start a mesh matcap section when I have a post on this material option.

<!-- SHADER MATERIAL SECTION -->

## sx-1-shader-white
* () This will be a very basic hello word type example where I just have a blob of white area

<!-- TEXTURES SECTION -->

Start a textures section where the focus is on textures and the various map options of materials

<!-- COMMON ( BASE MATERIAL CLASS ) SECTION -->

## () - sx-3-common-vertexcolor
* () vertex color examples

## () - sx-4-common-depthfunc
* () depth function demo

<!-- BASIC SECTION -->

## () - s1-5-basic-uvmapping
* () simular to that of texture demo but doing uv edits

## () - s1-6-basic-light
* () use a material like phong
* () add a direcitonal light source
* () both map and emissive maps used
* () color, emissive, and emissive intesnity options used

## () - s1-7-basic-common
* () basic common options demo
* () this can start out the same as s1-2-basic-objects only add a color attribute
* () set the use vertex colors boolen for all of the materials used
* () might also choose to use other common material class features such as blending, opacity, ect keep in basic though

<!-- MESH SECTION -->
