# threejs-materials todo list

<!-- MATERAL ARRAY SECTION -->

It would be nice to have a section where I get into material arrays, and groups of buffer geometry. If so I should have at least one demo in which I am using the Phong for metal surfaces, and Lambert for wood surfaces.

<!-- MeshMatcapMaterial SECTION-->

I should start a mesh matcap section when I have a post on this material option.

<!-- SHADER MATERIAL SECTION -->

<!-- TEXTURES SECTION -->

Start a textures section where the focus is on textures and the various map options of materials

<!-- BASE MATERIAL SECTION -->

I think that I should maybe have a seciton on the base material class where the focus is on common features of all materials
