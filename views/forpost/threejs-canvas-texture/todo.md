# threejs-canvas-texture todo list

## () - sx-x-cigrid section
* () start a color index grid section

## () - s2-3-loop-uv
* () loop example that involves static canvas texture, but updating uv attribute over time

## () - sx-x-textreader section
* () I would like to see about having a text reader module
* () The module should allow for loading external data in the form of plain text files such as javaScript and markdown files
* () canvas elements can then be used to create a current texture of a current point in a text file
* () I am thinking it would be cool to just use Plane geometry as a means to display the text


## () - sx-x-canvasjs basic
* () This just needs to be a functioning hello world example of r1 of canvas.js

## () - canvasjs - r1
* (done) start the file based off of the example in the basic section
<!-- improve the square built in draw function -->
* () refine the square method so that I can have more than one square in the canvas
* () have it so that I can set linewidth, cx, cy, size, and strokeColor, and fillColor for each square
<!-- improve the rnd built in draw function -->
* () refine the rnd built in draw function

<!-- data texture support -->
* ()
