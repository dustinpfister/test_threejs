# threejs-spotlights

These are the source code examples that I have together for my [post on spotlights in threejs](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/04/11/threejs-spotlights/). There are a number of features to cover when it comes to thins kind of light source that have to do with much more than that of the standard set of arguments with a light source that are just the color and intensity values. For example there is the distance over which the light will decay as well as the rate of decay for that. On top of that there is also setting the angle from the center of a cone of sorts, and also additonal values of interest when it comes to just the spot light itself.
