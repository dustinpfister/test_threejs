# threejs-buffer-geometry-index

The [index property of a buffer geometry class instance](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2022/12/09/threejs-buffer-geometry-index/) in threejs will store a buffer attribute as its value that is an index for points in the position attribute of the geometry. Simply put this is a way to define just a few points in space in the position attribite and then  use this index property as a way to define what the triangles of the geometry should be. In other words it is a way to reuse points in the positon attribute, thus allowing for a lower array size for the geometry in terms of the number of points needed.
