# threejs-examples-position-things-to-sphere-surface

The goal of the example here is to create a module that helps with the process of positioning an object to the surface of a sphere to which I have [wrote a blog post in which I write about this in detail](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/05/14/threejs-examples-position-things-to-sphere-surface/). There are a number of ways to do something like this as with just about everything in programing of course. The first version of this example involved creating a group and adding an object to position to the sphere to that, and then setting the rotation of the group to set the position of the object to the sphere. Although a system like that might work I have found that I like other ways of doing this that involve the set from Euler method, or raycasters.
