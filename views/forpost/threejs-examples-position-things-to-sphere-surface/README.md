# threejs-examples-position-things-to-sphere-surface

The goal of the example here is to create a module that helps with the process of positioning an object to the surface of a sphere. There are a number of ways to do somehting like this as with just about everything in programinbg of course. The first version of this example involved creating a group and adding an object to position to the sphere to that, and then setting the rotation of the group to set the position of the object to the spehere. Although a system like that migth work I have found that I like other ways of doing this that involve the set from euler method, or raycasters.
