# threejs-camera-orthographic

This is the source code examples that I am writing about on my blog post on the [orthographic camera](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/05/17/threejs-camera-orthographic/) in threejs. This is just about the only other kind of camera that I would use in place of the usual perspective camera every once in a while. The main differences is how the size of the objects change as the distance from the camera to the object goes up. With the perspective camera objects will get smaller while with the orthographic camera this will not be the case.

Another cool thing that I made while working on this post and the source code examples for it is this cube stack module that I am using to cerate a subject to look at when it comes to switching between these two kinds of cameras to showcase the difference.
