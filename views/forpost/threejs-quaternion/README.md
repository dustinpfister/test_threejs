# threejs-quaternion

There is a lot to take in when it comes to quaternion objects in threejs as they are a little more complex compared to Euler angles. However much of that complexity might every well be justified as there are problems like [Gimbel Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock) that happen with Euler angles.
