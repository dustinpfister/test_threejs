# s1-1-basic 

I need to start somewhere when it comes to quaternion objects. This is then the very first demo that I have made on this subject that can serve as a basic example in a post on the subject. Well at least is is based on the r146 demo quaternion-basic r146 demo, and from that I have not made many changes.
