# s3-1-loop-sphererotation


This is based off of my quaternion-rotate-sphere r146 demo

The goal with this demo is to just rotate a sphere around using one or more quaternion objects. In the process of doing so I hope to learn more about what there is to work with when it comes to class prototype methods.
