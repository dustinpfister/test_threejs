# euler-tofrom

Just a basic demo of creating a quaternion from a Euler and also getting a Euler from a quaternion. When it comes to the object3d class it looks like I can just set the rotation property to update the quaternion, and also do things the other way around. There are also methods for when I am working with these objects by themselves.
