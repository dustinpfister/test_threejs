# s2-1-methods-setfromaxisangle

This demo is based off of the source code of my quaternion-methods-setfromaxisangle r146 demo. The general goal of that demo as well as this one for the threejs-quaternion post is to just have a nice, basic loop example of the method. This might end up being used for the very first video for the post, so I want to make just a few more changes at least with this one. One thing that I would like to do is adjust the angle for the axis. One way to do this might involve using both quaternions and Eulers to adjust thing the way that I would like them for this demo at least
