# svg-test

These are a few simple test svg files that I made while working on my examples-svg-tools r146 prototype. This is also a folder that I can use to expand with these kinds of files when it comes to working more so on that prototype, a for post project based off of that prototype, or anything that involves just simply testing out or using the SVG loader.
