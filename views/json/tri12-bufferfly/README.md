# tri12-butterfly

I would like to work out everything that needs to happen when it comes to starting an over all style for hand coded 3d models. With that said I have started this JSON folder that contains a JSON file for a model of a butterfly that is composed of just four triangles. This then falls under a set of rules that I started with my other JSON folder 'tri12-trees' in which I am making trees that are composed of no more than 12 triangles.

## set1 - buffer geometry

When I started this project I still did not have a clear over all idea of how to structure these json files. Also I have not yet deiced if I should go with an over all object format, or make all of these files buffer geometry format json files. In any case this first set is in the buffer geometry format. There are morph attributes of course in these files then, however there is no animation clip data in terms of the timing and alphas as that is all mesh object, and animation mixer level stuff.
