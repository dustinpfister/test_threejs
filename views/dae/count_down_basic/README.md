# count_down_basic

The goal here is to create a set of objects to use in my first set of 'count down' videos.

## cd1.blend - start numbers

This blender file, and all DAE files after it is the first set of number objects. This is the first set of geometry as well as uv maps that are set up for the file.

* (done) have numbers 0-9
* (done) start uv map

## cd2.blend - fix uv mapping, add other objects

I ran into a werid problem with the DAE Loader when editing a mesh object. This made me create this first cd2 file as a way to try to figure out what the deal is with this, while not messing up what I have going on with cd1. The main goal here is to reduce the number of points in the numbers, and not end up with the weird problem loadind the mesh obejcts.

* (done) fix werid uv rendreing with num 4
* (done) fix uv with 1

* () add base object on which to place numbers
