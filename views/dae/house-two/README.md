# house-two 

It looks like my house threejs project example post is my best prefroming threejs project example post. Which is not so great as that is a post I made a long time ago and it is not at all my best foot forward. So I think that I will be making a new threejs project xample post soon and as such I will be making one or more house models that way that I would make them today. Which is by workin gout the geometry that I want in blender and then export that to a DAE file which I will then load in by way of the DAE loader.
