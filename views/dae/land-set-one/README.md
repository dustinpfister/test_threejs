# land-set-one

As I make my blog post videos I have found that I would like to step away from always using the built in geometry constructors as something to look at while demoing some other feature of threejs. So then this is a dae file that aims to be a collection of objects that can be used to furnish a land scene. The general idea is to have a few geometries that look like trees, rocks, and other objects that might be found in a nature scene.
