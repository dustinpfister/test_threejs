# land-set-one DAE File

As I make my blog post videos I have found that I would like to step away from always using the built in geometry constructors as something to look at while making videos that just demo some feature of threejs. This is a dae file that aims to be a collection of objects that can be used to furnish a land scene. The general idea is to have a few geometries that look like trees, rocks, and other objects that might be found in nature.

## object-grid-wrap-land

The main project that makes use of this dae file is late revisions of [my object grid wrap land module](https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-examples-object-grid-wrap-land). On top of having trees in the file there are also a number of objects that I am using for land tiles in that module.
