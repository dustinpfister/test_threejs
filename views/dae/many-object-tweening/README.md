# many-object-tweening

What I want to do with this DAE as well as addtional javaScript code is to make a system where I have many geometry states, each with names, and I can tween from one to another. Also there is tweening to another state, while tweening from one state to another which is somehting I world like to work out.

* have many objects in the dae that all have a name.
* have sets of objects like box-1, box-2, ect
* have javaScript that can transition a geometry from one state to another
* have javaScript where one state can transation to another while transitioning to another state
