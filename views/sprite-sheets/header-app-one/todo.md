## () - Use a dae file to create the header-app-one sheet
create a ship dae file
use what was worked out for threejs examples dae tools for post project to load the ship dae file
create a sprite sheet using the dae file

## () - crude yet effective first ship sheet
* just use the ConeGeometry constrcuor to create a 'ship'
* create a scene in which we have a 'ship' object for each cell in a sprite sheet
