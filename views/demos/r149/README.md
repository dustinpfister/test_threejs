## threejs r149 demos

Looks like this is the first revision in which I will be using JSM, and also sadly the last revision of threejs that I will be using also possibly as it looks like r150 is breaking on Raspberry PI OS. I like to work on that kind of system and do my best to work with the limitations, but I am now getting to many errors and the WebGlrenderer has now totally cashed and burned.
