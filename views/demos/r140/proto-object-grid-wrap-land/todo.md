# proto-object-grid-wrap-land

## () - new demo idea that is a next step with this
* () use data textures for grass
* () have a createTreeOne helper
* () have a createCube helper
* () have an option for createCube and createSlope helpers that allow for adding a tree as a child

## () - basic idea working
* (done) have a cube as one object
* (done) have a slop as another object
* (done) starting geo for slope
* (done) makeSlopeMesh helper function
* (done) simple system where I manuanly set what object to use for each grid location
* (done) fixed problem with position of geometry
* (done) have a nice looking 10 x 10 starting grid for the demo
* (done) have at least one location with an alt of 2

* () see about making a new method for opcaity where opcaity is not lost at all until a certin min distance form center is found
