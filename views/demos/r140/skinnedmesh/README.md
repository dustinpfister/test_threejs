## skinned mesh demo

So far this feature of threejs results in a loss of context webgl error in chromium 90.x on rpi os buster. This is because it would seem that webgl 2.0 is disabled and thus this will not work, at least not with late versions of threejs such as r140

## Check out the r111 demo

I started a new demo folder for my r111 collection of demos for skinned mesh. Thus far this does not result in a loss of context, but I still have not got it working there also. However the reason why might becuase of a user problem on my part as well as not finidn any decent hello world like examples of this.
