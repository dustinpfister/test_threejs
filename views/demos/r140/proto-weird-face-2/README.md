# weird-face-2

This is a more advanced version of my werid face 1 model that I made a while back. There are two general things I would like to work out here, one of which is to have a better standard for the state of the dae file, the other is to have more to work with when it comes to the state of the face. 

## One DAE file standard

In werid face 1 I hade two dae files, one of which for the base geomeyryu of the face and another that contains mouth geomeyry. In this example I would like to work out a stanard where everything that I want to work with is in just one file. 


## better emotional range

In this example I would like to add more to work with in terms of mouth geometry and additional features that help to convay a greater range of emotion with the face. This means more than one set of geometryes with the mouth, as well as new geomeries that have to do with eye lids and eye brows.
