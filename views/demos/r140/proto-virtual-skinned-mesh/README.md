# virtule-skinned-mesh prototype

The idea that I have in mind here is to find a way to prefrom what is done with skinned mesh objects with javaScript code. I have not got far with this one and it will prove to be very complex to get it to work. If I can find a solution that has been all ready made that will of cousre be prefered.

If there is at all a way to do this it goes without saying that updating the geometry will end up happening very slowly. So I can understanbd why there would be a tack of interest in making this sort of thing. However I tend to kind to make video projects with threejs, so for me it would just be a kind of wating longer for my frames to render kind of situation if I can actually find a way to get this to work.

A better way would be to just use computers that support webGL2 well so that I can just use the SkinnedMesh class thought. This proto might nto get anywhere then.
