# find between two vectors demo

This is a demo for some code that has to do with just getting a vector between two vectors. I have found out a wayto do so invloving the use of the add and divide scalar methods. However I have also just remembered that I can also just use the lerp method of the vector3 class also to get a vector at a midpoint between two vectors by always giviing a value of 0.5 for the alpha value.

I am thinking at this time that I will not be using this for the sake of a stand alone blog post on the topic, maybe. In any case I might want to make another section on the lerp method on this subject to say the least. If I go the rought of making a stand alone post on this subject I might want to do more than just write about getting a vector between two vectors.
