## shader-material-hatch basic demo

This is a custom shader material demo [based off some code that I found on the open interent at code pen](https://codepen.io/EvanBacon/pen/xgEBPX) that was authored by [Evan Bacon](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix). I hacked over it a fair amount as it was authord fro a very old revision number of threejs (r57).
