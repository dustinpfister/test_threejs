# quaternion-methods-setfromunitvectors r146 demo

This is my first main demo on the set from unit vectors method of the quaternion class. I am sure that I will want to have a main post on this method, however I can also use this as a starting point for making some improvements for my main blog post on quaternion objects as well.
