# examples-camera-planes r146 demo todo list

* (done) start with the code that was all ready worked out for the demo in threejs-camera-perspective
* (done) so far it looks like just setting the z value of the camera to 1 works okay
* (done) start a camerPlanes module
* () I will want a cameraPlanes.createFromCamera method where I pass a camera object along with options
* (done) I will want a cmarePlanes.create method that will just take options and create a camera
