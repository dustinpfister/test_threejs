# quaternion-helpers r146 demo

Sadly it would seem that there is not a built in quaternion helper in threejs. However there is working with other helpers like the arrow helper that will work good for showing the direction of the vector part of a quaternion. There is then maybe even going so far as to create a helper of my own for this kind of object if need be as well.

For this demo I think I might want to start making my own custom helper from the ground up.
