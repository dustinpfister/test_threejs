# curves-module

This is a protoype for a javaScript module for createing curve paths in threejs. The main goal here first and formost is having a way to create camera movement paths, hoever the module can also be used to crate paths for any object3d based object such as mesh objects and groups as well.

There is also the possiblity of using this module to create position attribites for custom buffer geomerty as well, but that is somehting that is on the back burner for now.
