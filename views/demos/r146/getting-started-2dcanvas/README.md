# getting-started-2dcanvas r146 demo

All I wanted to do with this demo is create a start point where I am actually using a plain old 2d canvas to render. I can then just use the drawImage method to draw to the 2d canvas with the canvas element from the webgl renderer. This allows for me to easly just have a simple 2d background, and overlay as needed.
