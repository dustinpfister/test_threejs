# animation-vector-keyframe-track r146 demo

There is making a whole bunch of prototypes on just threejs animation features. Not just for the sake of writing more posts, but also for my own edification as this is still an area of the library where I have more to learn. For this demo I would just like to make a vector keyframe track object, and maybe also a few more things that branch off from that when it comes to things like animation clips.
