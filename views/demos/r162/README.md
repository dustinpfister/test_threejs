# threejs r162 style rules, and notes

Looks like this will be the [last revision of threejs that will have webgl1 support](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/25959). If I still want to support older devices, and also use my Raspberry PI 4 I might have to stick with this revision forever, look into making my own custom renderer for threejs, or just start using something other than my RPI 4.

## Style rules

For now the rules will be the same as with r152. I might make a few simple changes at this time as I do not have anything locked with with r162 at this time
