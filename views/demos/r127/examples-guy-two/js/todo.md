## todo list for guy two

The aim here is to make a model that is an improvement from the guy one model that I made, while still not getting to involved with this.

## 0.0.0 - Basic starting point of guy two
    * (done) guy should be composed of a head, and chest that are just single mesh objects using the Box Geometry constructor
    * a arm, should be a nested group composed of Mesh objects for bicept, tricept, and hand
    * a leg should be a nested group composed of Mesh objects like an arm but with thigh, cafe, and foot.
