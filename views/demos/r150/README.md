## threejs r150 notes

looks like threejs r150 is broken I get this error:

```
Program Info Log: Vertex shader is not compiled.
```

I might have to give up with r150 as the next revision to work with as it does not work on any compute that I have thus far. The isshue might be with the webgl renderer alone, but still that is a big problem.
