## examples-curve-nellipse

I would like to start a module where I extend the base curve class to create a new curve class that is used to create an N-ellipse. Simply put this is just any ellipse that is three or more foci. I have looked into a number of resources as to how to go about making this kind of curve class, but thus far have not pieced something together that I really like with this.

Thus far I think that the process should be to just start with x and y values that the same as if I was to create a circle, but then figure out deltas for each foci and adjust from there.
