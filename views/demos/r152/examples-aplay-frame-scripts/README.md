# examples-aplay-sin-frames r152 demo

This is the next demo that I made after what I started with my examples-aplay-sin-frames r152 demo. The next step forward might have to involve just further refining what I all ready have with that demo just a little. The main feature here might be to have more that one script for processing the data for each frame, and this of course should be one of the options when writing the json file.

## The Bytes Per Frame data value

```
// Sample rate  / Frame Rate = Bytes Per Frame
//  2,010       / 30         =    67
//  2,100       / 30         =    70
//  8,100       / 30         =   270
// 16,200       / 30         =   540
// 42,000       / 30         = 1,400
```
