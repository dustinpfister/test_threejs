# matcap-material demo for r152

I might write a full blog post on this mesh material option, but in any case I will at the very least want to expand my main blog post on matreials with a nice getting started type example of this mesh matreial option. In ither case I will want at least one, basic, getting started typpe demo of it. With that said this demo aims to be a good starting point involving a canvas texture and the use of the matcap option of the material.
