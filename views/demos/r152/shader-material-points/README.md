# shader-material-points r152 demo

The goal with this demo is to create a custom shader that is an alternative to THREE.PointsMaterial which seems to cause my raspberry PI to freeze up. I have no idea what the isshue would be with that, and it is possible that the problem might be with the use of THREE.Points in any capacity, and a custom shader will not change anything with that. Still I would like to see about doing making a cusotm shader material to be used with THREE.Points.
