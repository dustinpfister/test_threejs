# examples-glsl-es1-renderer

So it looks like the threejs devs are going to remove the WebGl1 rendrer in a future revision \( r163 \) which means that I will have to stick with r162 from that point forward \( assuming that it will work with my Raspberry PI 4 to begin with \). However the idea has occured to me that a good idea for a threejs project would be to start my own webgl renderer. I am not sure what to call it just yet, but often I think I should call it by the GLSL spec rather than WebGl1. So then something like THREE.GLSLES1Renderer rather than THREE.WebGL1Renderer. In any case this would be a major project that miggt go beyond what I can manage as a solo dev at least. That is unless I maybe take it on with a proper mindset as to what this kind of project needs to be.
