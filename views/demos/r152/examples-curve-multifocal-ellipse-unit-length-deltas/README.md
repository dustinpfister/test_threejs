## examples-curve-multifocal-ellipse-unit-length-deltas

This is a demo where I am trying out something new with what I started for the examples-curve-multifocal-ellipse r152 demo. I am trying out a whole new process where I just use the distanceTo method of the Vector2 class to get a distance to a foci, and then use that to figure out what a delta should be for both x and y. For this demo the distance will just effect a unit length delta for each Vector.
