# animation-clip r152 demo

The goal here is to just create an animaiton clip object and that is it. Of course it would also be nice to apply that object to get an effect as well. However there are a lot of other features that come into play with that, and the goal here is to start the very first demo of what might end up being the basic section of a post on this subject.
