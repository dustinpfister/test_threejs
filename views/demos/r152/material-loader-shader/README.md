# material-loader-shader r152 demo

I would like to work out at least a few demos on the material loader as I might write a blog post on the subject. Also when it comes to the possibility of using the materials loader in a project I would assume that there is a way to use it to load materials that will be instances of the shader material. However I have found that I should assume nothing when it comes to these things, so I am starting this demo on this subject.
