### more than one sheet for texture used for the guys face
* have a set of three textures for the guys face
* work out a system where and array of seq.secs values are used to set the current texture for the guys face
* make it so that the face textures sink up with what is being said

## point light ring
* add a ring or white point lights that become active during section sq2
* have the radius of the point lights expand and contract
* have the intensity of the point lights adjust over time following a sine wave pattern

## raw4 () - tree improvements
* (done) have ten sections of cones for each tree made with the tree rather than tree_sphere model
* emissve maps, NOT COLORS for materials used for trees
* adjust emissive intensity values for tree materials for each sequence

### raw3 ( done 6/5/2021 ) - sequence two disco effects
* (done) point light removed from camera and added to scene
* (done) custom materials for trees
* (done) custom materials for ground 
* (done) have a group of spot lights using different colors
* (done) guy moves arms and legs during sq2
* (done) standard materials for guy

### raw2 ( done 6/5/2021 ) - tree grid position system
* (done) start a system where threes are created and positioned positioned on the plane following a grid of values
* (done) each gird value where each value is a model index at that grid location
* (done) guy moves up off ground during sequence 2
* (done) guy moves head in sq1 and sq2

### - raw1 ( done 6/4/2021 ) - started sequences
* (done) sequence one where the camera goes from the ground up to a set height started
* (done) sequence two where the camera goes around in a circle a few times started
* (done) sequence three where the camera goes back down to the ground started
* (done) frame rates are adjusted to sink up with audio files worked out for final video
