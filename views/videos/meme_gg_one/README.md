# meme_gg_one

This is the first of a series of videos following the my name is [Giovanni Giorgio](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-name-is-giovanni-giorgio) meme. So then this series will be my first collection of actual content when it comes to making videos, and while I am at it I will also be refining some things when it comes to making videos in general with threejs and a little additional vanilla javaScript code.

## 1 - New things worked out in this video

This is an attempt at making my first real project video that I might publish, or at the very least it is a step in that direction. Even if that does not end up being the case there are a few things that I worked out in this video that I will likely carry over into other videos.

### 1.1 - The tile-positioner.js module

This is a module that allows for me to create a string of index values where each index value is an object to place at a location in a plane. For this video I am using it as a way to position trees in various locations.
