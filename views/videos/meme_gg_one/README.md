This is the first of a series of videos following the my name is [Giovanni Giorgio](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/my-name-is-giovanni-giorgio) meme. So then this series will be my first collection of actual content when it comes to making videos, and while I am at it I will also be refining some things when it comes to making videos in general with threejs and a little additional vanilla javaScript code.

## 1 - New things worked out in this video and other note worthy features

This is an attempt at making my first real project video that I might publish, or at the very least it is a step in that direction. Even if that does not end up being the case there are a few things that I worked out in this video that I will likely carry over into other videos.

### 1.2 - Improvements to my tree model

In this video I made use of the tree model that I made for my [threejs examples tree](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/07/30/threejs-examples-tree/) post. WHen doing so I made a few minor improvements to the module when it comes to setting the lengths of the cones.

### 1.3 - Emissive map effects

In this video I am making use of emissive map effects. This includes setting the emissive intensity values to 0 for sequences 1 and 3, but having variable intensity for sequence 1.

### 1.4 - Point Light RIng

Another feature of this video is a point light ring module that I am using for additional lighting effects in sq2
