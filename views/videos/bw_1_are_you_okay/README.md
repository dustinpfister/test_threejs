## 1 - New things worked out in this video and other note worthy features

new things worked out for this video

### 1.1 - Started using modules parked in new /js/modules_group folder

Starting with a new guy1 v0.0.0 folder of guy.js I am now creating and using group modules that I will be using accross more than one video. The idea here is that each time I need to make some kind of change or addition to a module I can do so as a new version of the same module in the given folder name in the modeuls_group folder. I can then use whatever version in whatver video rather than having all these copies in each video folder which is not at all what I am going to want to do if I do end up making a lot of these.
