# test_threejs

These are my three.js demos

## install

Like all of these projects I do not intend to pollute the npmjs name space with this, so if you want to check these out, you will have to clone it in with git, and do a npm install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs
$ cd test_threejs
$ npm install
```
