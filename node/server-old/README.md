# server-old

This is the old server script for this project that I was using for years that was located at the main root folder. I just made a few quick changes to help get it to work from this new location, and then made the main index file at root call this script as a way to just keep things going as is, but in a way where I am starting to plan out the future for some things with nodejs scripts.
